Summary
If you're new to AI agents, this is the perfect place to start. In just 25 minutes, you'll learn exactly what an AI agent is, how it differs from traditional automations, and how to build one from scratch using n8n — no coding required. We’ll cover the core components of agent systems, how to set up guardrails, how agents interact with APIs, and what kinds of tools they can use. By the end, you'll have a working AI agent that can think, remember, and take action — and a clear understanding of how to build more. This is a hands-on, beginner-friendly guide designed to take you from zero to a working agent with practical, real-world applications.

This integration allows for more complex workflows and customized solutions, but the pricing models often hide these additional costs until you're deep into development.

I'm not 70 yet — but I am a lifelong tinkerer raised on dusty keyboards, late-night coding marathons, and a deep love for tech that keeps evolving faster than I can blink. This video hit me like a lightning bolt .

For someone trying to bridge the gap between classic know-how and the AI revolution, this tutorial didn’t just inform — it empowered. I’ve spent the past few weeks knee-deep in agents, APIs, and automation stacks, trying to make sense of how it all connects. Your clarity, pacing, and real-world examples lit up the path like a lantern in the fog .

What stood out most? You treated the audience with respect — no overhyped “get rich quick” vibes, just thoughtful guidance that feels like a conversation, not a sales pitch. That’s rare these days.

 Now, thanks to this video, I’ve successfully built my first working AI agent, and I’m already sketching out a system to streamline tasks for a local family business in Việt Nam. You’ve not just taught — you’ve inspired.

In a probing, live conversation with head of TED Chris Anderson, Altman discusses the astonishing growth of AI and shows how models like ChatGPT could soon become extensions of ourselves. He also addresses questions of safety, power and moral authority, reflecting on the world he envisions — where AI will almost certainly outpace human intelligence.

Essentials: Functional Programming's Y Combinator - Computerphile,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T8A89jgeTI&pp=ygUPTGFtYmRhIENhbGN1bHVz0gcJCRUKAYcqIYzv,@CheezyRusher,"Because this video basically said go to wikipedia, I'll try to explain what Y Combinator is.

YC is a way to name your function in a language that does not allow such pointers. It proves that function names, classes, etc. are just syntactic sugar. Let's look at the same example:

function factorialFn(number){ 
    return number == 1 ? 1: number * factorialFn(number-1)
}

The only thing that generates a pointer in lambda calculus is a function parameter. So let's rewrite everything to anonymous functions.

// This is the mind bending part, a function takes in the factorial function, returns factorial function that takes a number
(factorialFn)=>
  (number) =>  number == 1 ? 1: number * factorialFn(number-1)

Let's call this our Prepared function - we know it would work, but we don't know how to run it yet.

So how do we pass the internal function into itself? Looks impossible, right? We could just pass garbage(empty function) to get the internal function and use this to generate the actual function. 

((factorialFn)=>
  (number) =>  number == 1 ? 1: number * factorialFn(number-1))
(((factorialFn)=>
    (number) =>  number == 1 ? 1: number * factorialFn(number-1))
(()=> console.log('garbage')))

Trying number 2 would return a correct answer, but number 3 would call the garbage function. 

You could just calculate how many times you will need to recurse and nest that many times, so that garbage function would never get called? :P Kinda defeats the purpose. What if we made a function that would nest functions for us?

Let's look at the same example as in the video of the simplest recursion:

(fn) => fn(fn)

If we give this function to itself, it will repeat to no end:

((x) => x(x))((y) => y(y)) 

same fn, just different variable names for readability. The ""y"" function becomes a variable ""x"" after the first application, the x function repeats to infinity. This is the essence of YC. So how do we make this to call our function?

Well Lambda calculus allows only way, same as before, as a function parameter:

(yourPreparedFn) => 
   (x => x(x))(y => yourPreparedFn(number => y(y)(number)))

// The number function exists because I wanted this to be valid JS, and JS is not lazy - it's arguments are immediately evaluated, else the second part could have been just y=> yourPreparedFn(y(y))

If you try to run the function in your head, you will see that the ""y"" variable is ""y"" function itself. The first part (x => x(x)) makes that happen as it calls the function and passes the function to itself. And now you are thinking with portals.

The second part becomes easier to understand. Because y function has a reference to itself, it has an ability to loop by simply doing y(y). And it can share this ability with your Prepared function. When your Prepared function calls factorialFn with the next number, it's not actually calling factorialFn - it calls y function that generates the next factorialFn and then calls it with the number you passed.

This is it, that's Y combinator:

Y = f => (x => x(x))(x => f(y => x(x)(y)))

You can run this JS to and try to debug or break it for better understanding:

((yourPreparedFn) => 
   (x => x(x))(y => yourPreparedFn(number => y(y)(number))))
((factorialFn)=>
  (number) =>  number == 1 ? 1: number * factorialFn(number-1))

Which to me meant that the argument of `f` will never be calculated, thus we won't ever be able to call the `f`.

But that's only true if we eagerly evaluate the arguments. But we can postpone this evaluation until it's needed.
E.g. in the factorial calculator we only need `f` when we call it in the ""else"" case:

var fac_calc = f => n =>
    n == 0
    ? 1
    : n * f(n -1)      // < only here we need the actual function of the `f`

which means that the actual unwrapping of `f` to the next step of recursion in `f(…)` can happen on demand.
So `f(f(…))` turns into `f( lazy f ( lazy f(…) ) )`.

For laziness we can declare functions with no arguments, that upon call will do some calculations:

() => calculate_the_answer(42)

Thus we redefine our `rec` and `fac_calc` to use lazy evaluation:

var rec = f => f(() => rec( f ) )

Then we can define our factorial calculator as:

var fac_calc = f => n =>
    n == 0
    ? 1
    : n * f()(n -1)      // unwrap lazy `f` and then call it

And then derive factorial fn from rec + fac_calc:

var fac = rec(fac_calc);

And finally call it:

fac(3); // = 6

Hope it helps someone else.
Also see CheezyRusher's comment with great explanation of Y Combinator.

P.S.: this is how we can define lazy `rec` via a Y combinator:

var rec = f => (x => f(() => x(x))) (x => f(() => x(x)))",comment,8년 전,7900,340797,2590000,5년 전(수정됨),2025-11-27,Lambda Calculus,0.69530016

The button components took a function parameter to call when pressed. Since in Minesweeper pressing an empty cell (no adjacent bombs, i.e. no number) reveals the cells around it, I wrote a recursive function that when given a row and column number revealed the cell value in that spot and called the function for the cells around it if the cell was empty. I used lambda to iteratively create functions using that function while passing in a set row and column.
TL:DR you can use lambda to create a version of a defined function with filled in parameters",comment,2년 전,9300,240941,315000,1년 전,2025-11-27,Lambda Calculus,0.52201927

It would be fantastic if we could have a comprehensive course on industry-standard frameworks like Angular, .NET Core, and React. Imagine learning to combine Angular for the frontend, .NET Core for the backend, and Workbench for the database to build enterprise-level projects. This hands-on experience would help us master these frameworks, from RESTful API development to seamless frontend-backend communication. It's a skill set that's in high demand in the industry, and it would give us a competitive edge in our careers. Your consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated!",comment,3년 전,170000,3947002,7290000,2년 전,2025-11-27,PHP Development Roadmap,0.6336025

But I have a recommendation: Teach specific courses aimed at those, like me, who are not looking for a traditional employment, but wants to learn programming to develop programs (AI agents, data driven tools, web and native apps, interactive games, etc.), or become a consultant. I think the days of programming to make others become billionaire are over. I would also like to see the day when we have alternatives to the big (irresponsible and dangerous) tech companies today. We need more and more tech entrepreneurs.",comment,1년 전,29000,1259479,4870000,5개월 전,2025-11-27,PHP Development Roadmap,0.6066104

WHY ME?
If this is your first watch—hi, I’m Nick! TLDR: I spent five years building automated businesses with Make.com (most notably 1SecondCopy, a content company that hit 7 figures). Today a lot of people talk about automation, but I’ve noticed that very few have practical, real world success making money with it. So this channel is me chiming in and showing you what real systems that make real revenue look like! 

Hopefully I can help you improve your business, and in doing so, the rest of your life :-)

The insights in this report reveal everything you could possibly want to know about how people are working with Kubernetes today (and how they plan to work with Kubernetes in the future).

Join the authors of our 2021 Kubernetes Adoption Trends Report to learn about everything Kubernetes in this livestream. We cover the following questions (in addition to many others):

• What workloads are being run on Kubernetes?
• How many workloads are organizations running on Kubernetes?
• What is the #1 problem that people have with Kubernetes?
• What are organizations planning for their future use of Kubernetes?

If you're planning on self-hosting a multi-region CockroachDB cluster, you will need to know how many nodes you need in each region. In our Standard Tier in CockroachDB Cloud, you can choose a specific number of vCPUs to use across the entire cluster. To get started with CockroachDB Cloud for free, visit https://cockroa.ch/3DVXbwF

For example, if one region is busier than another at any given time, it will receive more vCPUs. As usage patterns shift across the cluster and regions change throughout the day, so will the distribution of vCPUs.

To show you how Asymmetric Workloads in CockroachDB Cloud work, join Cockroach Labs Technical Evangelist Rob Reid as he brings explanations, diagrams, and demos with a financial services use case to this video.

My suggesstion:
Actual result is not necessary. If test case is failed you will be changing the status of it. Once bug fixed, u will retest the test case and change the status to pass.
Test case name is missing in this.
Test description - by the name we can understand that it should be descriptive. So elobrate the test case description.",comment,8년 전,29000,2221142,166000,5년 전(수정됨),2025-11-27,테스트 케이스 관리 JIRA,0.6058194

I'm not 70 yet — but I am a lifelong tinkerer raised on dusty keyboards, late-night coding marathons, and a deep love for tech that keeps evolving faster than I can blink. This video hit me like a lightning bolt .

For someone trying to bridge the gap between classic know-how and the AI revolution, this tutorial didn’t just inform — it empowered. I’ve spent the past few weeks knee-deep in agents, APIs, and automation stacks, trying to make sense of how it all connects. Your clarity, pacing, and real-world examples lit up the path like a lantern in the fog .

What stood out most? You treated the audience with respect — no overhyped “get rich quick” vibes, just thoughtful guidance that feels like a conversation, not a sales pitch. That’s rare these days.

 Now, thanks to this video, I’ve successfully built my first working AI agent, and I’m already sketching out a system to streamline tasks for a local family business in Việt Nam. You’ve not just taught — you’ve inspired.

In a probing, live conversation with head of TED Chris Anderson, Altman discusses the astonishing growth of AI and shows how models like ChatGPT could soon become extensions of ourselves. He also addresses questions of safety, power and moral authority, reflecting on the world he envisions — where AI will almost certainly outpace human intelligence.

"코딩할 줄 몰라도 다 된다... AI가 연 '바이브 코딩'과 로우코드/노코드 부상, 진짜 개발자는 없어지나?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPVTY0M4hE&pp=ygUkQUnsmYAg7ZWo6ruYIO2FjOyKpO2KuCDsvZTrk5wg7J6R7ISx0gcJCRUKAYcqIYzv,Uploader(Desc),"인공지능 코딩 보조 기술인 '바이브 코딩'과 로우코드/노코드 도구의 부상으로 소프트웨어 개발 방식이 근본적으로 변화하고 있습니다. 테슬라와 OpenAI에서 활동한 안드레이 카파시가 제시한 바이브 코딩은 AI에게 자연어로 지시하여 프로그램을 만드는 새로운 코딩 방식입니다. 이는 GPT-4, LLaMA 같은 초거대 언어 모델이 방대한 데이터로 학습되어 가능해졌습니다. 대표적인 AI 코딩 도구인 Cursor AI나 GitHub Copilot은 코드 생성 및 수정, 버그 해결 보조 등을 통해 개발 생산성을 크게 높이고 있습니다. AI가 코딩 작업 속도를 평균 55%까지 빠르게 하지만, 개발자는 AI가 생성한 코드를 검토하고 통합하는 데 더 많은 시간을 할애하기도 합니다. 한편, 로우코드/노코드 플랫폼은 적은 코드 또는 코드 작성 없이도 애플리케이션 제작을 가능하게 하여 개발의 민주화를 목표로 합니다. 이는 개발 인력 부족과 소프트웨어 수요 증가 문제를 해결하고, 현업과 개발자 간 소통을 원활하게 하는 대안으로 주목받고 있습니다. 가트너에 따르면 글로벌 로우코드/노코드 시장은 고속 성장 중이며, Microsoft Power Platform과 같은 플랫폼은 이미 수천만 명의 사용자를 확보했습니다. 흥미롭게도 로우코드 툴의 주요 사용자는 오히려 전문 개발자들이며, 비개발자의 활용도 AI 통합으로 점차 쉬워지고 있습니다. 이러한 변화는 개발자의 역할을 단순 코딩에서 벗어나 설계, 관리, AI와의 협업 중심으로 변화시킬 것입니다. 개발자는 AI의 산출물을 검토하고 조정하는 디렉터나 품질관리자 역할을 수행하며, 기본기 강화와 함께 인간 고유의 문제 해결 및 설계 역량이 더욱 중요해집니다. 결국 AI 코딩 보조와 로우코드/노코드 도구를 능동적으로 받아들이고 자신의 역량을 재정비하는 개발자가 이 변화의 시대에 가치 있는 인재로 남을 것입니다.

What Is AI Distillation — And How DeepSeek Used It To Blindside OpenAI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzgUOKFrHcA&pp=ygUdS25vd2xlZGdlIERpc3RpbGxhdGlvbiDquLDsiKA%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Silicon Valley is now reckoning with a technique in AI development that could upend the leaderboard. Distillation is the idea that a small team with virtually no resources can make an advanced AI model by extracting knowledge from a larger one. While the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek didn’t invent the method, its use of the technique roiled the stock market and woke the AI world up to its disruptive potential. Distillation is now enabling less-capitalized startups and research labs to compete at the cutting edge faster than ever before. DeepSeek’s breakthroughs also ushered in the rise of a new open-source order, based on a belief that transparency and accessibility drive innovation faster than closed-door research. That combination -- distillation’s newfound traction and open-source’s rise in popularity -- is deadly for the competitive edges that the biggest AI players had. This video also includes Bosa’s full interview with Glean CEO Arvind Jain.

If you are talking about deepseek R1, they shared everything even the details of training it and building it from scratch. The R1 cant be distilled from O1 as openAi hide the chain of thoughts generated from O1. And R1's chains of thoughts has no Human Feedback in it compared to O1, and it proved its chain of thoughts is way better and smarter. They used reinforcement learning.
If you are talking about distilled smaller models? those were distilled from R1.
You can distill from gpt O1 a normal model and its gonna be extremly expensive but never a thinking model. 
R1 presented really different technics and its fully open source, and anyone who can understand basic AI keywords can see by himself its impossible to build R1 from openAi GPTs by distillation.

Those are the innovations. Distillation is not the story here.  How do we know?  Because their CoT (chain of thought) technique has been reproduced already, because they shared their techniques, and this technique improves other models to make them ""think"" before answering, having an ""internal dialog"", and it has little to do with distillation.  This story really misses the mark.

Also, calling it ""distillation"" is a bit of a stretch.  They don't have the entire probability vector of tokens, just the one-hot output of the chosen token.  Helpful? Sure, but so is just pretraining on large internet datasets, scientific papers, other synthetic data, etc. Distillation would typically train on the entire unembedding matrix, that is, the probability of every word for every word that is predicted in the stream and makes a distilled (student) model take on the qualities of the larger model (teacher) much more effectively.

First, we explain what a model distillation is. Then, we introduce two popular strategies for distillation, logits distillation and hidden states distillation. We study in detail how they work and how they're implemented in the Arcee DistillKit open-source library. Finally, we look at two Arcee models built with distillation, Arcee SuperNova 70B and Arcee SuperNova Medius 14B.

Note: my calculation at 18:45 is wrong. It's 2.3 Tera tokens, not 2.3 Peta tokens. Sorry about that 🤡

Symbolic knowledge models are usually trained on human-generated corpora that are cumbersome and expensive to create. Such corpora consist of structured triples of symbolic knowledge. This paper takes a different approach and attempts to generate such a corpus by prompting GPT-3. Results show that clever prompting, combined with targeted small critic models trained on human ratings can outperform both human-generated data, as well as the teacher model (GPT-3) itself. The results of this paper give a general recipe for automatically building corpora for various NLP tasks by extracting samples from large language models.

Abstract:
The common practice for training commonsense models has gone from-human-to-corpus-to-machine: humans author commonsense knowledge graphs in order to train commonsense models. In this work, we investigate an alternative, from-machine-to-corpus-to-machine: general language models author these commonsense knowledge graphs to train commonsense models. Our study leads to a new framework, Symbolic Knowledge Distillation. As with prior art in Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), our approach uses larger models to teach smaller models. A key difference is that we distill knowledge symbolically-as text-in addition to the neural model. We also distill only one aspect-the commonsense of a general language model teacher, allowing the student to be a different type, a commonsense model. Altogether, we show that careful prompt engineering and a separately trained critic model allow us to selectively distill high-quality causal commonsense from GPT-3, a general language model. Empirical results demonstrate that, for the first time, a human-authored commonsense knowledge graph is surpassed by our automatically distilled variant in all three criteria: quantity, quality, and diversity. In addition, it results in a neural commonsense model that surpasses the teacher model's commonsense capabilities despite its 100x smaller size. We apply this to the ATOMIC resource, and share our new symbolic knowledge graph and commonsense models.

If the language model is able to be its own critic, one might be able to move significantly further towards eliminating the humans from the loop. ""Generate a thing for me.

Knowledge Distillation has lead to new advances in compression, training state of the art models, and stabilizing Transformers for Computer Vision. All you need to do to build on this is swap out the Teacher and Student architectures. I think the example of how to overwrite keras.Model and integrate two loss functions controlled with an alpha hyperparameter weighting is very useful as well.

Some recent stacks and toolkits around Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have emerged where users are building applications such as chatbots using LLMs on their own private data. This opens the door to a vast array of applications. However while setting up a naive RAG stack is easy, productionizing it is hard. In this talk, we talk about core techniques for evaluating and improving your retrieval systems for better performing RAG.

복잡한 문서에 대한 생산 RAG 구축,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_TmTW9S4c&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRZMTE0gQXBwbGljYXRpb24g6rWs7LaV,Uploader(Desc),"Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users search for, interact with, and generate new content. Some recent stacks and toolkits around Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have emerged, enabling users to build applications such as chatbots using LLMs on their private data. However, while setting up naive RAG is straightforward, building production RAG is very challenging, especially as users scale to larger and more complex data sources. A classic example is a large number of PDFs with embedded tables.   RAG is only as good as your data, and developers must carefully consider how to parse, ingest, and retrieve their data to successfully build RAG over complex documents. This session provides an in-depth exploration of this entire process; you will get an overview of the process around building a RAG pipeline that can handle messy, complicated PDF documents. This includes implementing a parsing strategy for parsing a complex document with embedded objects. This consists of an indexing strategy to process these documents beyond simple chunking techniques. We will then explore various advanced retrieval algorithms to handle questions about the tabular and unstructured data and discuss their use cases and tradeoffs.

I have a RAG pipeline and the vector storage and retrieval layers are working just fine. I see the right results come back with the right content. I then pass that content (paragraphs from a book) over to the llm, along with the user query. It seems incapable of finding the answer using the content I provided it. I tried many models, mostly 70Bs since my system can run those. I am not exceeding the token limits, far from it. If I only give it one search result, it's able to reason over it just fine. As soon as I try to pass it more results it completely disregards most of them and only looks at the last 2 or so. I copy pasted the same content into ChatGpt and it answered the question just fine  and reasoned over the entirety of the content. Are local models inherently limited somehow? Even though I am not exceeding the token length, it seems they all forget the early context. If so, how do I get around this? Make one call into the llm per search result?

That was because python had a lot a really great set of tools for working in this space. Now that we have LLMs like Open AI’s GPT-4 where the P stands for pre-trained we can simply call them like we would any other API. Java is everywhere in the enterprise and we need to start thinking about how to integrate these capabilities into our applications. 

In today’s tutorial I want to talk about communicating with an LLM like GPT-4 (or any other LLM) and some of the challenges you might come across. From there I’ll introduce you Spring AI which is going to help us build AI powered applications by solving some of these challenges.

Spring AI 1.0 Updates

The syntax for some of the features we went through in this video might have changed a little bit with the release of 1.0. Please check out this video I did on the changes in 1.0.0 M1

"PDF와 채팅하기 - Gen AI 앱 - Amazon Bedrock, RAG, S3, Langchain 및 Streamlit 사용 [실습]",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFibP7KnDVM&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRZMTE0gQXBwbGljYXRpb24g6rWs7LaV,Uploader(Desc),"In this video we will build a CHATBOT like application with AWS Amazon Bedrock, docker, python, Langchain, and Streamlit. We will use Retrieval-Augmented generation concept to provide context to the Large Language model along with user query to generate response from our Knowledgebase.

Time Stamps:
0:00 -  Introduction
0:35 - Quick Demo 
3:44 - Application Architecture and details
8:40 - Build Admin Web App
42:40 - Build Client Web App and wrap

This is a hands-on tutorial where I will demonstrate the following:
Architecture of the applications
Build 2 applications (ADMIN and USER) and create DOCKER images
ADMIN Application: 
Build Admin Web application where AdminUser can upload the pdf.
The PDF text is split into chunks
Using the Amazon Titan Embedding Model, create the vector representation of the chunks
Using FAISS, save the vector index locally
Upload the index to Amazon S3 bucket (You can use other vector stores like OpenSearch, Pinecone, PgVector etc., but for this demo, I chose cost effective S3)
USER Application:
Build User Web application where users can query / chat with the pdf.
At the application start, download the index files from S3 to build local FAISS index (vector store)
Langchain's RetrievalQA, does the following:
Convert the User's query to vector embedding using Amazon Titan Embedding Model (Make sure to use the same model that was used for creating the chunk's embedding on the Admin side)
Do similarity search to the FAISS index and retrieve 5 relevant documents pertaining to the user query to build the context
Using Prompt template, provide the question and context to the Large Language Model. We are using Claude model from Anthropic.
Display the LLM's response to the user.

자율 AI 에이전트 - 왜 여러분이 만들어야 하는지... 그리고 어떻게 만들어야 하는지.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4teb28H2i70&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRbsnpDsnKggQUkg7JeQ7J207KCE7Yq4,,"CORRECTIONS

I sometimes have to post corrections to videos, so I use pinned comments (this thing here) so people see it.

I got a lot of pushback on my comments about Python, so I do want to clarify what I mean:

For new people who are just starting to learn how to code, the whole process is daunting and the learning curve is steep. You have to figure out IF you need to learn to code, WHAT language to learn, WHICH dev tools to use, college or online... the list goes on and on.

I think this stops a lot of people just due to decision fatigue alone.

My goal was to make it so simple that people would be kicked into action. Just ""LEARN PYTHON. USE GOOGLE COLLAB"".


Once people start coding and building useful applications, then can start expanding their knowledge, add other languages etc. The learning process is addicting and will carry them further.

Only 0.5% of the world can code!

We need to get more people to start learning to do it.

So for people just starting to code and interested in AI:
JUST LEARN PYTHON

In the past year, I have been constantly ""injesting"" information about AI from a HUGE amount of sources, some good, some bad, I have made a lot of experience building with AI and I have been thinking about autonomous agents for a while. I believe that I made myself a pretty solid idea of the ""quality"" of the sources, and it made me much quicker at learning.

That being said, I can confidently say that this is a really well done video, you know what you are talking about, and you realise where AI is going. It's also incredibly inspiring and well thought.
When I need inspiration, I will probably come back to this.

I have spent a lot of hours coding with it so far and it is both amazing and frustrating as hell sometimes.

You’re prompts totally dictate the IQ level of the conversation. I’ve seen this many times where I start a coding project on GPT 4 and it’s totally in sync with what I want and it’s code output and brainstorming are top notch. After a couple of hours in the project conversation all that can go totally off track and it’s as though GPT 4 decided to take a break and it’s dumb brother got behind the wheel instead as it starts failing to understand the simplest of prompts. I’ve found at that point it’s best to gather what you’ve got so far and start a new conversation.",comment,2년 전,10000,318489,303000,2년 전,2025-11-27,자율 AI 에이전트,0.58292043

Finally, I asked A and B to consider each other's ideas and come up with a new idea by fusing the two together.

The outcome was amazing. This is the future of brainstorming! You can even instruct the chatbots to be experts in different fields, such as A being a teacher and B being an engineer.

👉    • A Custom AI Agent Framework  

SUMMARY ⤵️
Over the last 18 months, I've been building autonomous AI Agents. They used to suck, but now they're so good that we fully believe it's time for every business to embed them within their processes.

Just so we're clear...
↳ I don't know how to code
↳ I'm not an ""AI Engineer""
↳ I just want to use AI to make more money for my business...

WHY ME?
If this is your first watch—hi, I’m 👋 Devin! TLDR: I spent the last 18 months building AI Agents, AI Applications, and AI Automations. Today a lot of people talk about AI Agents, but I’ve noticed that very few have practical, real world success integrating them into their businesses. So this channel is me showing you how to build useful AI Agents that can operate your business 24/7 - allowing you to focus on the activities that will actually lead to growth.

It exudes intelligence, and I will definitely watch other videos from you. My takeaway is that there is a lot of work to be done by non-coders around thinking about what their workflows are and how they are enabled by different tools or subtasks and how to lay these tools / tasks down on a piece of paper and connect them. The one area that still prevents me from embarking on that journey is the lack of familiarity with a lot of the tools you mention in your video and the lack of time in my day to both do my job as well as take time to automate it.

Autonomous AI has been just an idea, and I hadn't seen anything that actually worked. But now, we have an autonomous AI agent that actually does, and it's kind of scary how good it already is. You tell it what you want it to do, and it uses your computer to complete the task like organising your email inbox, replying to people, booking flights, ordering groceries without you even lifting a finger. It's still slow and there are limits to what it can do. But it's scary how quickly AI is evolving.

If we're using AI to do some task 'better,' it means whatever that task is (ordering pizza, booking a trip, etc.) the processed sucked to begin with.  When companies figure this out, wouldn't they escalate their experiences, perhaps build in their own AI functionalities, to make performing such a task 'better' than what it is now?  These AI agents are great... but just a layer between a human doing a task, and a currently existing platform or platforms that kinda suck at the process/system of doing such task.",comment,2년 전,841,62014,82899,1년 전,2025-11-27,자율 AI 에이전트,0.47817513

“Before asking whether AI would threaten human lives, our perspectives of AI technology should be changed.”

[AI FRAMEWORK] is NC’s new series of contents that propose “A New Perspective of AI” through the eyes of globally renowned scholars that think of the future of AI and mankind. CSO Songyee Yoon that has taken the lead in establishment of the AI Center of NCSOFT and has researched ethical issues of cutting-edge technologies will meet the leaders from various fields, including engineering, politics, and philosophy, and share each other’s thoughts and perspectives.

The first person to share such new perspectives is Dr. Fei-Fei Li, Co-Director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). We proudly present our first story on the vision and mission of the Stanford Institute for HAI and the new framework to view the AI technology with the aim to develop a human-centered AI.

AI가 인간 증강만을 위해서 사용되진 않을 겁니다. 기업 입장에서는 인건비를 줄일 수 있다면 줄이는 것이 합리적입니다. AI는 실제로 많은 영역에서 노동자를 대체하게 될 것이라고 생각합니다. 저는 이 문제에 대해서 사회적 논의가 충분히 되어야한다고 생각합니다.
최근에는 AI가 채용 면접도 진행하고 미국에서는 범죄자의 위험성을 측정하는 AI 솔루션도 개발된 적이 있다고 들었습니다. 영상에서 말씀하신 것처럼 이런 중요한 의사결정을 하는 제품과 솔루션은 쏟아지는데 지금의 AI는 블랙박스나 다름 없다는 것이 큰 문제인 것 같네요. 제품이 먼저 나오고 구색을 나중에 갖추는 상태인 것 같아 조금 우려스럽습니다. 설명 가능한 AI 연구가 정말 절실한 것 같네요. 앞으로도 이런 좋은 논의가 계속 되었으면 좋겠습니다. 좋은 영상 감사합니다.",comment,4년 전,161,161292,765000,4년 전,2025-11-27,인간 중심의 AI 기술,0.52157307

제임스 랜데이 교수 (스탠퍼드대학교 컴퓨터공학과, 인간중심 인공지능연구소(HAI) 공동소장)

제임스 랜데이 교수는 이제 인류의 더 나은 미래를 위해 AI를 활용하자는 'AI for Good'이라는 이니셔티브를 넘어서서, 진정한 '인간 중심 AI'가 필요하다는 점을 강조합니다. 또한 랜데이 교수는 AI가 특정 측면에만 집중될 것이 아니라, 사용자와 커뮤니티, 그리고 사회 전반의 영향을 균형 있게 고려해서 개발되어야 한다고 말합니다.

“AI For Good” Isn’t Good Enough: A Call for Human-Centered AI""
Professor James Landay emphasizes that it's time to move beyond the 'AI for Good' initiative, and instead recognize the need for truly 'human-centered AI.' 
He argues that AI should be developed with a balanced consideration of its impact not only users but communities and society ensuring a positive influence on all.

ChatGPT Prompt I Used:
When you open the app, you see a clean welcome screen. After signing up with email, you land on the main dashboard. Here you see your tasks sorted by AI priority. You can add tasks through quick-add or by chatting with AI. When ready to focus, you enter Focus Mode which blocks notifications and starts a timer. After completing a session, you see your progress and can start another session or take a break.

I am building a productivity app that helps users focus on one task at a time. I need a detailed and structured explanation of the app's flow and features, written as a Markdown file, so that it is easy for an app developer to understand and implement. Use the Context over to write this.

[PgDay 2025 Seoul] PostgreSQL을 활용한 벡터DB 구축 경험과 벡터 인덱스 최적화 전략,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJcbvP_O-ZI&pp=ygUa64yA6rec66qoIOuyoe2EsCBEQiDqtazstpXSBwkJFQoBhyohjO8%3D,Uploader(Desc),"최근 AI 서비스 확산으로 벡터 데이터 검색의 중요성이 급부상하고 있습니다.
PostgreSQL의 pgvector 확장은 벡터 데이터를 관계형 데이터베이스에서 효율적으로 처리할 수 있게 해줍니다.

본 발표에서는 스타트업이 실제 서비스 환경에서 PostgreSQL 기반 벡터DB를 구축하고 운영한 경험을 공유하며, 대규모 데이터셋을 다룰 때 마주한 현실적인 성능 한계와 그 해결 방안을 심도 있게 다룹니다.

특히, 벡터 인덱스 유형인 ivfflat과 hnsw 방식의 상세 비교를 통해 데이터 크기 및 벡터 차원(dimension)에 따라 성능을 최적화한 사례를 제시하며, DBA 및 데이터 엔지니어가 실제 벡터DB를 운영할 때 반드시 고려해야 할 핵심 요소들을 짚어볼 예정입니다.

발표를 통해 PostgreSQL의 강력한 벡터 검색 기능 활용 방안과 함께 운영 중 직면할 수 있는 이슈를 명확히 이해하고, 최적화된 벡터DB 운영 전략을 세우는 데 필요한 정보를 제공하고자 합니다.

Prompt도 조사와 연습이 많이 필요합니다. 내가 얼마나 자세히 상상했느냐에 따라 구현되는 결과물이 다르더라구요. 이것 또한 하나의 툴인 것이라는 회사에서 토론한 결과였습니다. 컨셉디자인 과정에서 활용한다면 유용한 툴이라고 생각합니다,comment,2년 전,6500,424595,1430000,2년 전,2025-11-27,AI로 생성한 이미지 평가,0.45623595

Google Stitch + Figma: AI 생성 UI 디자인에 대한 나의 생각,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL3PwDlJmNk&pp=ygUdVUkg65SU7J6Q7J24IEFJIOuPhOq1rCBTdGl0Y2g%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Google에서 AI 기반 UI 디자인 도구 ""Google Stitch""를 출시했습니다. 간단한 프롬프트에서 전체 레이아웃을 생성할 수 있으며, Figma로 내보낼 수도 있습니다. 하지만 이 도구가 실제 제품 디자이너에게 정말 유용할까요?

이 영상에서는 Google Stitch의 장점, 단점, 그리고 Figma 워크플로에 어떻게 적합한지(또는 적합하지 않은지)에 대해 설명합니다.

UX 및 제품 디자인 분야에서 20년 이상의 경험을 바탕으로 Stitch와 같은 도구가 *빠른 아이디어 구상*에는 유용하지만, 실제 디자인 시스템, 접근성 표준 또는 사려 깊은 UX 문제 해결을 대체하기에는 아직 턱없이 부족한 이유를 보여드리겠습니다.

👀 학습 내용:
Google Stitch란 무엇인가요?
Figma AI와 비교하면 어떤가요?
AI가 UX 디자인 사고를 대체할 수 없는 이유
Stitch가 실제 제품 워크플로에 어떻게 적용되는지
실제 사례: Google Stitch → Figma 핸드오프
📌 챕터:
00:00 – Google Stitch가 UI 디자인을 망쳤나요?
00:30 – Google Stitch의 실제 의미
01:15 – 디자이너들은 당황해야 할까요?
02:00 – UX는 레이아웃이 아닌 문제 해결에 관한 것
03:00 – Figma 및 실제 디자인 시스템과의 비교
04:30 – 심층 분석: Figma에서 Google Stitch 사용하기
06:00 – AI 생성 레이아웃의 한계
07:00 – 최종 평가 + 여러분의 차례

Obsidian은 노트를 연결하는 기능을 제공하고, 마크다운과 일반 텍스트를 사용하여 노트를 저장하며, 플러그인 생태계와 노트 간의 주제와 관계를 살펴볼 수 있는 시각적 지식 그래프를 제공합니다. 하지만 독점적인 서비스인 Logseq가 있습니다. Logseq는 노트를 마크다운 파일로 저장하고, 150개 이상의 플러그인과 다양한 테마를 제공하며, 모바일 앱도 있고, 비공개로 운영되며, 동일한 연결 기능과 지식 그래프를 제공합니다.

노트에 입력한 링크와 데이터를 기반으로 필요한 모든 정보가 포함된 표를 생성하는 쿼리도 생성할 수 있습니다. Logseq는 필요한 경우 자체 동기화 솔루션도 제공합니다. Linux, AppImage, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android에서 사용할 수 있습니다.

또 다른 강력한 앱은 Notion입니다. Notion은 무료이지만 독점 서비스이며 공식 Linux 버전이 없습니다.

오픈 소스 세계에서 찾을 수 있는 가장 가까운 것은 AppFlowy입니다. AppFlowy는 매우 유사하지만 아직 기능이 완벽하지는 않습니다. 페이지와 하위 페이지로 구성된 나만의 구조를 만들 수 있으며, 캘린더, 보드, 표, 문서 등 몇 가지 페이지 유형을 사용할 수 있습니다. 또한 카드가 있는 보드를 표나 캘린더에 표시하는 것처럼 이러한 유형을 한 페이지에 혼합하여 사용할 수도 있지만, Notion에서 제공하는 템플릿만큼 다양하지는 않습니다.

더 완벽한 기능을 원한다면 AnyType을 사용해 보세요. AnyType 역시 오픈 소스이며 Linux 클라이언트와 모바일 앱을 제공하지만, 인터페이스가 AppFlowy보다 다소 복잡하고 사용하기가 다소 어렵습니다.

이 앱은 일반적으로 Slack이나 Microsoft Teams를 사용하는 회사나 프로젝트에서 사용하기 때문에 제어력이 부족할 수 있습니다. 하지만 모든 기능을 사용할 수 있다면 Mattermost를 고려해 보세요.

완전히 오픈 소스인 Slack/MS Teams 대안으로, 직접 호스팅할 수 있습니다. 채널을 생성하고, 사이드 스레드, 파일 공유, 화면 공유, 음성 통화를 통해 채팅을 할 수 있습니다. 다양한 개발자 도구와 통합하여 자동화할 수 있으며, 마크다운이나 코드 스니펫으로 메시지 서식을 지정할 수 있고, 모든 메시지를 보관하고 전체 기록 검색 기능을 사용할 수 있습니다.

보드만 정리해야 한다면 Trello를 사용해 보세요. Trello는 Focalboard로 쉽게 대체할 수 있습니다. 여러 사람이 같은 보드에 접속할 수 있도록 하려면 직접 호스팅하거나, macOS, Windows, Linux 애플리케이션과 함께 개인 앱으로 사용할 수 있습니다.

PDF 문서를 만들고 편집해야 한다면 Adobe의 Acrobat Pro를 사용할 수 있습니다. GIMP, Inkscape, LibreOffice Draw 등에서 PDF 문서를 열 수 있지만, 이러한 도구는 단일 페이지만 열거나 문서 서식을 손상시키는 경향이 있습니다. Libreoffice Draw는 시스템에 PDF에 사용된 모든 글꼴이 설치되어 있다면 훌륭한 기능을 제공하지만, 텍스트 편집은 일반적으로 단락으로 인식하는 대신 줄 단위로 처리되어 처리하기 어려울 수 있습니다.

Visual Studio Code의 ... 코드는 MIT 라이선스에 따라 라이선스가 부여되므로 오픈 소스/무료 소프트웨어 프로젝트이지만 Microsoft에서 제공하는 바이너리는 오픈 소스가 아닙니다. 따라서 대안은 간단합니다. VSCodium입니다. VS Code의 오픈 소스 부분을 기반으로 구축되었지만 모든 추적, 원격 분석 및 독점 구성 요소를 제거합니다. VS Code의 플러그인 및 확장 프로그램과 호환되며 정확히 동일한 인터페이스와 기능을 제공하지만 멋진 오픈 소스 형태입니다.

It is hard to find a beginners tutorial that is recent and that is important given how fast VSCode moves. I'm afraid you'll need to update it at least twice a year to keep current.
One suggestion though: for a beginners tutorial you should start with a fresh install. You have a number of extensions installed and you cover some features from them which a beginner will not see as they do not have those extensions. You could take them through installing the extensions you use when they first come up.
I am transitioning from just using VSCode as a code editor to using it as a full IDE, so I am kind of a beginner with stuff like Git, debugger and Docker. The thing that confused me with Git was that I had my Git account logged in to VSCode, working in the browser and even open in Git Desktop but VS Code still said 'waiting for extension to initialize' on all the UI elements to do with Git. I had not realized you ALSO need 'Git for Windows' installed! VSCode and Git could be a lot more helpful about this!",comment,4년 전,24000,1090591,1910000,4년 전,2025-11-27,VS Code 오픈소스 AI 에디터,0.47280115

GitHub Copilot X 설명 | 큰 진전...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_0DJ9FOlOM&t=110s&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRpHaXRIdWIgQ29waWxvdCBDaGF0IO2Gte2VqQ%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"A few days ago, GitHub released news of an upgrade to GitHub Copilot called GitHub Copilot X. With a new chat feature, PR ecosystem AI, CLI support, Voice coding, and integration with maintainer-written documentation, this is going to be a game-changer. 

With all the talk of ChatGPT and GPT-4, I feel we're missing out on the specific focus and cutting-edge innovation by Microsoft and its Copilot software. 

In this video, I want to walk you through the following:

1. How GitHub Copilot is making developers everywhere happy and
2. What is GitHub Copilot X and what features is it bringing to the table. 

We'll look at all the new features in detail with examples. 

There isn't a set GitHub Copilot X release date yet nor a pricing announcement. GitHub Copilot pricing is $10/mo for individuals and for businesses $19 per user per month. GitHub Copilot X requires an active GitHub Copilot license to get on the waitlist.

Let's discuss in the comments!

It's very difficult for solo/small group projects to get of the ground because of the time sink game development requires, and the potential for burnout after working on a project for so long leading to them never finishing.
AI can potentially speed up the development process, making it easier to finish before running out of money, or before you get bored of the project.

No to mention many of those ""replaced"" by AI may move on to becoming Indie devs as a result of no longer being able to pursue employment in game development.",comment,2년 전,3200,159607,325000,2년 전(수정됨),2025-11-27,GitHub Copilot Chat 통합,0.5634438

This is monopolization of the entire software development workflow. Till this point you had a bunch of companies who competed for each of those markets, and they employed testers, fullstack devs, q & a, designers. It’s obvious that this will wipeout all those companies and devs working to solve this issues. 
For a senior it will be easier and faster to write what he needs instead of giving the tasks to some other human being, or meeting with them to explain what they need.

I questioned renewing my VS Pro licenses when I keep using vs code so that I can use the latest tools (talk about breaking flow...) It's been super frustrating to not having the latest tools being hyped on the licensed product that I'm paying for. I hope to continue to see closer release parity between these Microsoft products. The more you do this the more inclined I am to stay a paying customer of the visual Studio Pro products.

Your timing couldn't be better - I've been stuck in analysis paralysis thinking I need to learn coding or raise tons of capital to build something meaningful. But you just proved that the barrier to entry has never been lower and the opportunity has never been bigger.

That story about your friend's startup growing 260% in one day is insane! And I love how you're not just throwing around theoretical ideas - you're actually building these content factories yourself and sharing real examples like Garfield AI and Logistify AI. The fact that you're hiring people with no experience because everything changes so fast really hit home.

Your advice to solve your own problem first is gold. I've been overthinking market analysis when I should just focus on what's frustrating me daily. The AI agents for small businesses idea especially resonates because I see so many local businesses struggling with basic automation.

Already bookmarked all the tools you mentioned - Lovable, Replit, and Poppy AI look incredible.

타임스탬프:
00:00 – 소개(2025년 일자리 시장 현황)
00:30 – 보존 모드에 있는 창업자 – 채용 속도 저하 및 면접 주기 연장
01:32 – AI 생산성 변화 – 채용 감소, 엔지니어에 대한 기대치 상승
03:00 – 마지막 10% 문제 – AI는 90% 속도 향상, 하지만 마무리 작업에는 여전히 사람이 필요
04:01 – 비현실적인 기대 – AI 과대평가, 단기 채용 추세
04:30 – 추천 = 불공정한 이점 – 네트워크가 300건 이상의 무작위 지원자를 이겼다
06:29 – 첫 번째 제안을 빠르게 받기 – ""완벽한"" 고소득 일자리를 기다리지 마세요
08:37 – 처음부터 준비하세요 – 스타트업 및 원격 근무에 대한 새로운 기대치 상승
10:07 – 클린 코드 및 기본 원칙 사고 – LeetCode의 힘든 작업만으로는 충분하지 않은 이유
12:10 – 폭 vs. 깊이 – 두 가지 엔지니어링 인도 생태계에서 두각을 나타내는 방법
14:00 – 결론 및 최종 조언

I tried coding a LLM Crypto Trading Bot (to retire early $$$),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYqNBY7i0hI&pp=ygUQQUkg7L2U65SpIOyLnOyepQ%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Ooooft, this one has been in the pipe for a while now but finally got around to finishing the edit. Seriously interesting experiment, I'm wondering if I should do some livestreams and we can tweak and backtest params live to see what works? 🤷🏽‍♂️

Probably will get back to reinforcement learning for ML and some deep visualisation stuff I've been wanting to get my hands on, alas I digress. In this, you're going to learn; 
1. How to hook up a bot to Kraken 
2. How to setup a LLM to help make trading decisions (see performance for yourself don't at me with ""you should've used {insert fav llm here} llm"" 😅
3. How to refactor all the code you just wrote and use finbert. 

All the code, logs and stuff is available via GitHub as always: https://github.com/nicknochnack/LLMAg...

Is there an AI coding bubble? Plus Meta’s new SlopTok product and more | E2184,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C9yL9-87So&t=1777s&pp=ygUQQUkg7L2U65SpIOyLnOyepdIHCQkVCgGHKiGM7w%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Today’s show: 

Factory, a Sequoia-backed producer of AI agents for programming, raised $50 million at a $300 million valuation. So Jason and Alex are wondering… how much capital is TOO MUCH?

We’re going deep on a question that often perplexes founders: How would weigh a HUGE potential market against STIFF pre-existing competition.

PLUS that Neon app that records your calls deleted itself, why AI ISN’T taking away all the radiology jobs yet, how inherent biases impact everyone’s view of the economy, ChatGPT may be getting ads very soon, and MUCH MUCH MORE.

Timestamps:

(0:00) The Neon app: why would anyone let an app record all of their phone calls?

(04:43) Another -slop term… What is THINKSLOP?!

(09:46) .TECH: Say it without saying it. Head to http://www.get.tech/twist or your favorite registrar to get a clean, sharp .tech domain today.

(11:25) Why is TikTok US only worth $14 billion?!

(17:10) Wait, why ISN’T AI taking jobs away from radiologists?

(20:06) Public - Take your investing to the next level with Public. Build a multi-asset portfolio and earn 4.1% APY on your cash—with no fees or minimums. Start now at http://public.com/twist

(28:38) How can xAI afford to sell AI to the US gov’t for 42 cents?

(29:37) Alphasense - Get deeper insights into your business with the power of AI search and market intelligence. Start with a free trial at https://www.alpha-sense.com/twist

(33:44) How inherent biases impact everyone’s view of the economy.

(46:29) Why is everyone dunking on Meta’s new SlopTok app?

(53:37) It certainly seems like ChatGPT is going to get ads soon…

(01:03:49) The first entry in our Gamma Pitch Deck Competition is II off-roading marketplace Where2Wheel

For example I just accept that ads are 'kind of' the price for free sources of information but I would never click on them without a good reason.

If I want to make something simple then yeah an AI tool can help me rough draft that in minutes. I've had it make changes to my window manager, write a Python script that enabled speech to text to run locally ( vosk ), and help me implement features in bash shell that I'm used to in fish.

But for challenging tasks that require 'taste' and intelligent reasoning about tradeoffs it just falls short. Ive been reviewing a LOT of vibe coding and it's a mixed bag: when it's good it's good and when it's bad it's laughably bad.

AI models work best when you are pedantic and precise; you dont give it room to hallucinate and your prompts have to ne very ordered to specify the kind of edge cases you eant to account for.

But at that point of specificity why not just use the language itself to articulate ideas?

It goes back to what a senior engineer told me about Eclipse and UML diagrams 'back in the day': the idea was to leverage the explicit nature of Java and the detail in UML class diagrams so that you could use it to generate code.

But LOL at that point you've just created another DSL / abstraction layer! Could've just done it in the original context.

So it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I'm sure it will improve and I'm not going to stop vibe coding and trying to push it to it's limits but you gotta call it like it is.

and to use the whole 'the guy using AI will take your job' angle: yeah, I guess but it's that true of all tools?

If you are using a handsaw to cut 2x4s on a job site you will get laughed at; use a circular saw or miter saw.

Why use a stapler when you can use a hammer stapler. A framing hammer is still needed at times but by and large you should be using a nail gun. Know your tools and use the right tool for the job and you'll be effective versus the person who refuses to adapt.",comment,4개월 전,1200,106362,3290000,4개월 전(수정됨),2025-11-27,AI 코딩 시장,0.5856777

AI가 코딩 작업 속도를 평균 55%까지 빠르게 하지만, 개발자는 AI가 생성한 코드를 검토하고 통합하는 데 더 많은 시간을 할애하기도 합니다. 한편, 로우코드/노코드 플랫폼은 적은 코드 또는 코드 작성 없이도 애플리케이션 제작을 가능하게 하여 개발의 민주화를 목표로 합니다. 이는 개발 인력 부족과 소프트웨어 수요 증가 문제를 해결하고, 현업과 개발자 간 소통을 원활하게 하는 대안으로 주목받고 있습니다. 가트너에 따르면 글로벌 로우코드/노코드 시장은 고속 성장 중이며, Microsoft Power Platform과 같은 플랫폼은 이미 수천만 명의 사용자를 확보했습니다. 흥미롭게도 로우코드 툴의 주요 사용자는 오히려 전문 개발자들이며, 비개발자의 활용도 AI 통합으로 점차 쉬워지고 있습니다. 이러한 변화는 개발자의 역할을 단순 코딩에서 벗어나 설계, 관리, AI와의 협업 중심으로 변화시킬 것입니다. 개발자는 AI의 산출물을 검토하고 조정하는 디렉터나 품질관리자 역할을 수행하며, 기본기 강화와 함께 인간 고유의 문제 해결 및 설계 역량이 더욱 중요해집니다. 결국 AI 코딩 보조와 로우코드/노코드 도구를 능동적으로 받아들이고 자신의 역량을 재정비하는 개발자가 이 변화의 시대에 가치 있는 인재로 남을 것입니다.

이번 영상에서는 무료로 활용할 수 있는 자동화 툴 n8n을 활용해, 일정 관리를 도와주는 AI 개인비서를 직접 만들어 보았습니다. 
n8n을 처음 사용해보는 분들도 따라하실 수 있도록, AI Agent의 각 요소에 대한 설명은 물론 구글 서비스 인증, 시스템 프롬프트까지 상세히 설명하였는데요. 

코딩없이 Ai Agent를 만들어서 활용해보고 싶으신 분이라면, 이번 영상 참고하셔서 본인만의 생산성을 높여주는 AI Agent를 만들어보시기 바랍니다. 

🧠 여러분은 어떤 AI 에이전트를 만들고 싶으신가요? 댓글로 공유해 주세요 :)

AI검색, AI에이전트는 마케팅의 패러다임을 어떻게 바꾸고 있을까요? 대기업은 어떻게 대응해야 하고, 자원이 부족했던 중소기업과 1인기업은 어떻게 이 기회를 활용해야 할까요? 강정수 박사의 이야기를 들어보시죠.

AI agent 개발에 있어서 tool을 만들어 주는 기준이 궁금한데요, openai에서 제공하는 llm api의 경우 곱하기, 더하기 정도는 tool을 만들지 않아도 잘 응답을 주는걸 확인했습니다.
tool은 llm이 똑똑해질수록 제공하지 않아도 되는건가요? llm이 충분히 똑똑하지 못해 적절한 응답을 주지 못할경우 tool을 만들어 사용할 수 있도록 지정해주는것이 올바른 방향인지 궁금합니다.",comment,9개월 전,504,14462,5230,4개월 전,2025-11-27,AI 에이전트 탐색,0.5812699

만약 누군가 250억에 크롬을 인수한다면 그는 일년 후 250억달러를 전부 회수하는데 무리가 없을 것이다.
그만큼 크롬의 가치는 크다는 의미다.

Picked up an interest in n8n, automation, AI driven workflows and finally Claude Code (1 week quite intense experience). I am shocked, I know exactly what Cal is talking about, and the question about sub agents - the answer is preservation of context in master and all .MD files as a condition from the outset, and when developing complex workflows to keep hammering claude code to auto update.
It helps to name sub agents, literally, so much easier to call them up, and to build this in to .md files. 
So, on my login - I am greeted by sonnet 4 (Little Sister), Sergeant Major (Master Orchestrator), Chloe, Daisy, Dixy and Dawn all subagents, linked but distinct and evolving roles. Auto improvement and best practice also baked in.

Down side is I hit my limit so easily now as the project evolves. I am learning and loving this - still with zero developer or computing background.

오늘날 Anthropic의 클로드는 개발자들이 가장 선호하는 인물이며, 그의 팀은 그가 ""인류 역사상 가장 큰 규모의 인프라 구축""이라고 부르는 프로젝트를 감독하고 있습니다. The Lightcone의 이번 에피소드에서 그는 YC 창업자에서 AI 연구자로의 파격적인 여정, 모든 것을 바꾼 확장성 법칙의 발견, 그리고 오늘날 AI 분야에 뛰어드는 젊은 엔지니어들에게 주는 조언에 대해 이야기합니다.

As a software engineer I 100% agree that the perspective of software engineering getting jobs will change.

With all the tools(cursour, claude and etc) available it probably will require many engineers to be better sales professionals rather than genius engineers(which I still think many should have basic to intermidiate level of understanding).

링크: 
Docs.md: http://bit.ly/4nEz8EZ

이 심층적인 Claude Code 가이드에서는 Super Claude가 어떻게 Anthropic Claude Code를 진정한 AI 코딩의 동반자로 만들어 주는지 살펴봅니다. Context-7 및 Sequential MCP와 같은 Claude Code MCP 통합부터 고급 Claude Code 명령, 후크, 플래그까지, 이 가이드는 단순한 Claude 코드 리뷰 그 이상입니다. Claude Code와 Cursor가 실제 개발 워크플로에서 어떻게 활용되는지, 그리고 Claude 4 Opus와 적절한 설정 파일을 함께 사용하면 완전히 새로운 수준의 Vibe 코딩이 어떻게 구현되는지 확인할 수 있습니다.

AI에 심도 있게 접근하든 프롬프트 엔지니어링을 이제 막 시작하든, 이 클로드 코드 튜토리얼은 설정부터 실행까지 모든 것을 다룹니다. 여러 기기에서 클로드를 브라우저에 연결하는 방법, 커서 AI와 클로드가 docs.md와 claude.md를 사용하여 워크플로를 자동화하는 방법까지 다룹니다.

게다가, Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, SEO 지원 워크플로, 그리고 클로드와 커서 같은 도구를 기반으로 하는 AI 에이전트가 코딩을 그 어느 때보다 쉽게 만드는 방법에 대한 해설도 제공합니다.

클로드 코드를 효과적으로 사용하는 방법을 알고 싶거나 AI 에이전트 워크플로에서 커서와 클로드를 비교하고 싶다면, 바로 이 가이드가 정답입니다.

Set up a tailscale network. For personal set up its free, you can connect 100 devices. I have my Linux dev servers, phones and laptops all on it, and you can set it up no fuss. in a few minutes, you are away. I used this set up for code-server which is browser based vscode. I promise you its worth the 10 minutes setting it up, not just for this but also your general device security.

You're welcome to join my newsletter (https://patrickellis.beehiiv.com/subs...) or subscribe here, if you're a founder or software engineer looking to build faster and smarter with AI Agents like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, n8n, image/video gen, and other AI workflows.

Anthropic's Claude Code team just open-sourced the tooling they use to replace manual code reviews with AI agents. If you're drowning in AI-generated code, this agentic review system is the key to unlocking massive velocity while ensuring your code is secure and follows best practices.

This video is a step-by-step guide to implementing Anthropic's playbook. I break down their agentic review system, showing you how to use Slash Commands, custom Subagents, and fully automated GitHub Action runners to handle code and security audits. I'll also cover the high-level mental frameworks you need to build powerful, custom AI workflows for your own team.

Saw a claude-code demo a week ago, went home immediately and started playing. In a week, we, me and Claude, crafted an embedded cellular IoT app with a complete AWS data lake backend. Mind boggling is an understatement and Claude solved the bain of software development, documentation. Everything gets updated with every commit. Claude put the fun back in development. 

My next project is an industrial data acquisition system with about 20 interacting components. Couldn't sleep one night, I spent about 2 hours planning this project with claude phone app in bed.  We came up with a project plan, architectural layout and selected redis with Go because of its concurrency model. I know nothing about Go and am wondering if I even need to. We'll see.

I find I like right clicking Terminal in the panel and selecting send to secondary panel so that terminal/claude code opens right next to the cursor AI agent... then both are easily accessible in the same place and it feels natural in the IDE with both cursor and claude code in the same place. edit: (And this way it also doesn't take any more screen real estate than when using cursor's AI).,comment,5개월 전,958,36828,20400,5개월 전(수정됨),2025-11-27,Anthropic Claude Code 지원,0.5421667

Abstract :-

This project involves the development of a comprehensive water quality monitoring system based on the ESP32 microcontroller and the Adafruit platform. The system is designed to measure key water quality parameters, including Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), temperature, pH, and turbidity. The ESP32 processes data from various sensors that monitor these parameters, and the information is transmitted to the Adafruit platform for real-time visualization and analysis. This integration allows users to access detailed insights into water quality from any location, facilitating timely interventions and ensuring safe and clean water management. The system enhances environmental monitoring, supports water treatment processes, and provides valuable data for maintaining optimal water quality standards.

VPS 관리 초보자든 숙련된 사용자든, 이 루틴은 명확한 단계와 Kodee의 사용자 친화적인 가이드를 통해 프로세스를 간소화합니다. 안정성을 위해 먼저 서버의 가동 시간과 부하를 확인한 다음, 리소스 사용량을 면밀히 파악하여 성능 문제를 조기에 발견하세요.

We will design a Chatbot that can:
1. Chat with SQL DB that we create from SQL files
2. Chat with SQL DB that we create from CSV and XLSX files
3. Chat with  SQL DB that we create by uploading documents while using the chatbot
4. RAG with Tabular data

Moreover, in this video, I will show you why RAG is not a good option for interacting with your databases. The code is available on the Github repository.

Huggingface와 Pytorch를 사용하여 LLM을 미세 조정하여 무엇이든 가르치세요 | 단계별 튜토리얼,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZcKYiwtw1I&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBR7thYzsiqTtirgg642w7J207YSwIOyDneyEsSBMTE0%3D,Uploader(Desc),"This in-depth tutorial is about fine-tuning LLMs locally with Huggingface Transformers and Pytorch. We use Meta's new Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model and teach it to predict paper categories using LORA adapters. Along the way I break down all the major things you must know about fine-tuning, from prompting, creating datasets, generating input-output pairs, loss functions, pytorch optimizers, peft LORA adapters, and ofcourse the sweet feeling when the test accuracy goes up. :)

Notes on Hardware and Quantization:

I didn't go over quantization in this video, coz I'm on a Macbook and bitsandbytes don't work outside NVIDIA gpus. :) Hopefully, I'll make a separate video one day about quantization. 

The system I am using is a MacBook Pro M2 16GB ram. If you have nvidia gpus, you could leverage better quantization. For my machine, I was able to train with batch size of 8 in float32… the sequence lengths were around 250 on average for this task.

If I were working on a product, I’d rent cloud gpu servers and fine tune over there on large datasets. For a YT video with an educational intent, I decided to limit the scope to local machines.

지식 그래프와 LLM 에이전트를 사용한 테이블형 데이터베이스와의 채팅 및 RAG,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NP1llvtrbI&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBR7thYzsiqTtirgg642w7J207YSwIOyDneyEsSBMTE0%3D,Uploader(Desc),"In this video, together we will go through all the steps to construct a #knowledgegraph from Tabular Datasets and design a ChatBot APP to interact with the Knowledge Graph using natural language. For this purpose, we will use Knowledge Graph LLM agents and the GPT model. We will design a Chatbot that can:

1. Chat with Graph DB using an improved LLM agent
2. Chat with Graph DB using a simple LLM agent
3. RAG with Graph DB

Moreover, in this video, I will show you the second RAG approach for interacting with Tabular data but this time, using the knowledge graph. The code is available on the Github repository.

00:00 Overview  

02:05 Evaluations: The Core of the Development Cycle  
Frequent evaluations and rapid updates are central to applied AI. Evaluations can range from automated tests to more manual human reviews.

06:07 Walkthrough of a Unit Test  
Dan demonstrates a unit test in Python designed to test a simple LLM pipeline.

08:55 Unit Tests for LLMs  
Hamel explains the necessity of unit tests and their role in automating the validation of outputs.
To create effective unit tests, enumerate all features the AI should cover, define scenarios for each feature, and generate test data. Synthetic data can be created using LLMs to test various scenarios. 

18:56 LLM as a Judge  
To trust an LLM as a judge, iterate its outputs and measure their correlation with a trusted human standard using spreadsheets. Gradually align the LLM with human critiques to build confidence in its judgments.

21:18 Issues with Using LLMs as Judges  
Dan discusses potential issues with relying on LLMs as judges, primarily due to their inconsistency in results.

23:00 Human Evaluations  
Ongoing human review, data examination, and regular updates are necessary to maintain accuracy and prevent overfitting.

24:44 Rapid Evaluations Lead to Faster Iterations  

Using evaluation strategies effectively can help quickly identify and fix issues or failure cases.

26:30 Issues with Human Evaluations  
Human evaluations can be subjective, potentially leading to varying scores for the same output at different times. A/B testing can help mitigate these issues to some extent.

31:20 Analyzing Traces  
A trace is a sequence of events, such as multi-turn conversations or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) interactions. Analyzing traces (datasets) should be seamless to understand your data effectively.

35:30 Logging Traces  
Several tools, such as Langsmith, can log and view traces. It’s recommended to use off-the-shelf tools to speed up data analysis.

39:15 Langsmith Walkthrough  
Harrison demonstrates Langsmith, a tool for logging and testing LLM applications. Langsmith also supports visualization of traces and offers features like experiment filtering.

43:12 Datasets and Testing on Langsmith  
Langsmith allows various methods to import, filter, and group datasets. Experiments can be set up to assess model performance across these datasets.

51:35 Common Mistakes in Evaluating LLMs  
Bryan provides a brief overview of common pitfalls in LLM evaluation and how to avoid them.

1:12:40 Code Walkthrough: Evaluating Summaries for Hallucinations  
Eugene covers natural language inference (NLI) tasks and fine-tunes models to classify summaries as entailment, neutral, or disagreement.

1:33:03 Evaluating Agents  
Eugene details a step-by-step approach to evaluating agents, including breaking down tasks into classification and quality assessment metrics.

1:35:49 Evals, Rules, Guardrails, and Vibe Checks  
Effective AI evaluation requires a blend of general and task-specific metrics, along with tailored guardrails and validation to ensure accurate outputs.

1:44:24 Auto-Generated Assertions  
Shreya introduces Spade, a tool for generating and refining assertion criteria for AI pipelines by analyzing prompt edits and failures.

1:50:41 Interfaces for Evaluation Assistants  
Shreya discusses the development of more efficient UIs for evaluating and iterating on AI-generated outputs, emphasizing dynamic and human-in-the-loop interfaces to enhance evaluation criteria and processes.

One quick question on testing or evaluating the LLM
with these RAGAS metrics
1.For testing these metrics we need test data or
datasets
 in my case our rag app has almost 700
docuements
 how I can generate dataset for all 700
documents.
4.1 tried using testsetgenerator fun from ragas but
for that have to store
700 docs on my local
machine and need to provide path of those to
function.
Do we have any other way to generate dataset for
large number of documents",comment,1년 전,45,3446,4350,3개월 전,2025-11-27,테스트 데이터 생성 LLM,0.54987437

합성 테스트 데이터 생성으로 RAG 챗봇의 정확도를 높이세요!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rba4exIaOs&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBR7thYzsiqTtirgg642w7J207YSwIOyDneyEsSBMTE0%3D,Uploader(Desc),"In this video, I delve into the importance of synthetic test data generation, especially for evaluating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) augmented pipelines. Manually creating QA samples from documents is time-consuming and often lacks the complexity needed for a thorough evaluation. By leveraging synthetic data, developer time in the data aggregation process can be reduced by 90%.

I also introduce Ragas, a novel approach to generating evaluation data. Unlike standard methods, Ragas uses an evolutionary generation paradigm inspired by works like Evol-Instruct. This approach ensures that your evaluation dataset includes a wide range of question types and difficulty levels, providing a more comprehensive assessment of your pipeline’s performance.

"[투이컨설팅 122회 Y세미나] 최근 대형 IT 프로젝트, 왜 실패사례가 늘고있을까?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerpfHyVf1U&pp=ygUx64yA7ZiVIOyGjO2UhO2KuOybqOyWtCDtlITroZzsoJ3tirgg7Iuk7YyoIOybkOyduA%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"📢일정: 2023년 3월 21일 화요일 14:00 - 16:45
📢장소: 전경련타워 파인홀(3층)

최근 대형 IT 프로젝트의 실패사례가 급속히 늘고 있습니다. 프로젝트 현장의 목소리에 귀 기울여보면 단지 우연으로만 치부할 수 없습니다.
기업과 기관들에 요구되는 디지털 전환 속도에 대한 기대는 프로젝트 요구사항 정의를 더욱 어렵게 만들고 있습니다. 현업사용자는 요구사항을 제대로 정의하지 못합니다. 요구사항이 자주 바뀌게 됩니다. 처음에 정한 요구사항이 그대로 가는 경우가 거의 없습니다.
기술이 더욱 복잡해지고 빠르게 발전하고 있습니다. 디지털 전환을 위해 새로운 기술의 도입이 더욱 가속화되고 있지만 이러한 기술을 충분히 습득하지 못하고 있습니다. 또한 대부분의 업무가 이미 전산화되어 있고 내·외부가 복잡하게 연결되어 있습니다. 시스템 이행의 난이도가 급속도로 높아져 있습니다
사람들의 가치관이 변했습니다. 발주자, 수행사, 개발자 모두가 조직을 위해 헌신하기 보다는 자신의 워라밸을 더 중요하게 생각합니다. 위험과 난관을 극복하기 보다는 피하려고 합니다.
기술의 급속한 변화는 개발자들의 숙련도 감소를 유발하고 있으며 이로인해 개발 생산성이 과거보다 낮아졌습니다. 개발자들의 이동도 잦아졌습니다. 프로젝트 도중에도 다른 프로젝트로 이동하기도 합니다.
이러한 문제들이 복합적으로 작용하고 있습니다.

이번 Y세미나에서는 최근 대형 IT프로젝트의 실패 원인을 분석하고 이를 극복하기 위한 방안을 모색하고자 합니다.

스크린샷을 사용하여 수동 테스트 케이스를 자동으로 생성하는 방법 | Testcase Studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfJMcR7vEw&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRZRQSDrpqztj6ztirgg7J6Q64-Z7ZmU,Uploader(Desc),"Testcase Studio는 Sanjay Kumar가 개발한 혁신적인 확장 기능으로, 테스트 케이스 자동 생성 프로세스를 간소화합니다. 고급 기능을 통해 사용자 단계를 자동으로 기록하여 수동으로 테스트 케이스를 생성할 필요가 없습니다. 수동 테스터든 자동화 테스터든 테스트 케이스를 작성하게 됩니다.

테스트 케이스 작성은 시간이 많이 소요되는 작업입니다. 하지만 Testcase Studio는 코딩 지식이 전혀 필요하지 않습니다. Testcase Studio는 사용자의 작업을 기록하고, 필요한 단계를 지능적으로 캡처하여 스크린샷과 함께 완벽하게 작동하는 테스트 케이스로 변환합니다.

이러한 단계를 활용하여 버그를 제기하는 동안에도 테스트 케이스를 제작할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 테스터와 개발자 간의 효율적인 소통이 가능해져 버그 해결 속도가 향상됩니다.

Testcase Studio를 사용하면 귀중한 시간을 절약하고 전반적인 생산성을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.

This is Part VI of the Jenkins LambdaTest Tutorial series wherein Moss (@tech_with_moss), a DevOps engineer, explains about configuring Jenkins controller and Jenkins agent nodes to overcome the limitation of a single Jenkins instance. The growing organization needs to scale Jenkins on multiple platforms like Windows, Mac OS, Ubuntu, and Linux. 
Jenkins agents are machines to whom Jenkins controllers can delegate the task of building projects distributed across different platforms that support Java. It allows multi-platform build and testing using the same Jenkins Server.
An agent node might be a windows machine, a Linux machine, or some other platform that supports Java; this allows multi-platform build and testing using the same Jenkins server.  
You will also learn
🔸 How does Jenkins connect to Windows agent?
🔸 Where does Jenkins agent run?
🔸 How does Jenkins agents work?
🔸 How do you deploy Jenkins agent and connect it to Jenkins master?

Elon Musk ruined the API part, you can use some other APIs

Here's one of the subscriber built the same project using other APIs - https://chenmeiqiao.notion.site/How-I-Reach-Out-to-YouTubers-I-Like-As-A-Data-Engineer-c37bdddefde54c3789229ffa5a789432

or you can use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it


FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - 

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access

The amount of value you bring to the viewer in just 12 minutes is just incredible! Like you were saying ""the hassle of managing pipelines in python scripts"", I made a data project a while back, and I really can understand what you mean. I heard that Airflow makes everything easier, but I kept deferring Airflow learning, partly because ""maybe this is good for large data pipelines, but my one consists of just a few small tasks,"" and also because most YouTube videos of Airflow out there was a couple of hours long. And that's great if you are already committed to learn Airflow, but I was really looking for a video like yours - something that will give me a practical demo of how Airflow actually works, but it will be around 10-15 minutes. And this video was just perfect. Once again, thanks a whole lot! I'll definitely be integrating Airflow into my project now! And my resume too, God willing!",comment,2년 전,8600,404611,196000,1년 전,2025-11-27,DBT Airflow 데이터 파이프라인,0.512087

Who am I? 🙋🏻‍♂️
I'm Jay, I love making videos about travel, self-help and tech. I currently work in New York City as a data engineer, but I grew up in Malaysia and lived in the UK when I was 19. Back then, I had no idea what life was about, moving to so many places, navigating career in Tech. Today, I've learned a lot and wanna share my perspective through filmmaking.

I'd be happy to see you doing more ELT pipelines and focus on your thought's process ( I can watch longer format 1-2 hours) -  why you do things in that way, why is it important and whatnot; and you can throw some explainers to anything else you do and the reason behind it. I think senior DE and others with experience do things bit automatically and it takes time for the newbies to pick up on those skills. So, your thought process for doing things instead of just doing the things is priceless for anyone watching, including me.

What Is DBT and Why Is It So Popular -  Intro To Data Infrastructure Part 3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FZZivIfJVo&pp=ygUlREJUIEFpcmZsb3cg642w7J207YSwIO2MjOydtO2UhOudvOyduA%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"dbt란 무엇일까요?

Fishtown Analytics(현 dbt Labs)에서 개발한 데이터 빌드 도구 또는 dbt는 데이터 분석가, 데이터 엔지니어, 분석 엔지니어가 추출-로드-변환 파이프라인에서 ""변환"" 단계를 실행할 수 있도록 지원합니다.

SQL로 변환을 작성하고 회사 데이터베이스에 대해 실행하면 됩니다.

""분석 엔지니어링 도구""라고도 불리는 dbt는 오픈 소스이며 많은 기업의 최신 데이터 스택에 필수적인 요소로 자리 잡았습니다. 또한 dbt를 중심으로 탄탄한 지원 커뮤니티가 형성되어 있습니다.

Snowflake, Databricks 또는 Bigquery와 같은 다른 데이터 플랫폼에 로드할 도구를 찾고 계신가요? Estuary를 사용해 보세요. 저는 Estuary와 파트너십을 맺기 전에 여러 고객에게 Estuary를 사용했는데, Estuary 덕분에 전체 프로세스가 훨씬 수월해졌습니다.

System Design: TINDER as a microservice architecture,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tndzLznxq40&pp=ygUs66eI7J207YGs66Gc7ISc67mE7IqkIOyVhO2CpO2FjeyymCDrlJTsnpDsnbg%3D,Uploader(Desc),"다음 면접에서 좋은 결과를 얻고 싶으신가요? 이 시스템 설계 비디오 강좌를 수강해 보세요! 🔥
https://interviewready.io

틴더의 시스템 아키텍처를 설계합니다. 앱 설계는 시스템 요구 사항을 명확히 하는 것부터 시작됩니다. 면접에서 틴더는 여러 가지 요구 사항을 가지고 있습니다.

시스템을 설계할 때는 마이크로서비스 아키텍처를 기반으로 논리적 구성 요소를 도출하고 다른 서비스와의 상호 작용을 정의합니다. 내부 세부 사항은 시스템 설계 개념에 대한 사전 지식을 통해 처리할 수 있다고 가정합니다. 여기에는 부하 분산, 메시지 큐, 데이터베이스 등이 포함됩니다.

틴더 시스템은 프로필 저장, 추천, 매칭 기록, 매칭 상대와의 채팅이라는 네 가지 요구 사항을 가지고 있습니다. 프로필 저장은 이미지 저장을 제외하고는 간단하며, 이미지 저장에서는 BLOB와 파일 저장에 대한 논쟁이 있습니다. 이미지를 저장할 때는 분산 파일 아키텍처가 가장 적합합니다.

다이렉트 메시징이나 매칭 상대와의 채팅은 XMPP 프로토콜을 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다. XMPP 프로토콜은 웹 소켓을 사용하여 클라이언트와 서버 간에 P2P 통신을 수행합니다. 각 연결은 TCP 기반으로 구축되어 연결이 유지됩니다. 세션 마이크로서비스는 사용자 매핑 연결을 기반으로 수신자에게 메시지를 전송할 수 있습니다.

저희 시스템은 최대한 분리되어 있습니다. 클라이언트에서 수락 및 거부 정보를 유지하려고 노력합니다. 왼쪽이나 오른쪽으로 스와이프할 때 클라이언트는 해당 동작을 기록하고 블룸 필터를 사용하여 동일한 사용자를 다시 표시하지 않을 수 있습니다.

서버에는 매치 마이크로서비스라는 검증 엔진이 있으며, 이 엔진은 매치를 기록하고 두 사용자 간의 채팅을 허용 또는 거부합니다.

추천의 마지막 요건은 사용자 데이터를 도시별로 분할하는 것입니다. 이는 Cassandra나 Amazon Dynamo와 같은 NoSQL 데이터베이스를 사용하여 구현됩니다. 다른 옵션은 수평 분할을 지원하는 관계형 데이터베이스를 사용하는 것입니다. 이 개념을 샤딩이라고 합니다.

의문점, 제안 또는 피드백이 있으시면 아래에 남겨주시기 바랍니다. 이 시스템은 아직 완벽하지는 않지만, 한 시간 분량의 인터뷰를 진행하기에는 충분합니다.

면책 조항: 본 영상에는 Tinder의 내부 구현이 포함되어 있지 않으며, 이를 암시하지도 않습니다. 저희가 디자인한 시스템은 순전히 상상의 산물일 뿐이며, 실제 앱과는 아무런 연관이 없습니다. 틴더 엔지니어들이 이보다 더 나은 시스템을 만들어냈을 거라고 확신합니다!

What a database provides you is multi user concurrent access without corrupting your data and acid aspects. In theory there's hardly a case where you'd put a big blob in your database. Most often just use paths to big files and keep those paths in the database table. The paths could be on an NFS or whatever distributed file system there is. Your NFS can then deal with geolocation etc. You could create read only mount points across multiple geographical locations for the same file. I'm just leaving this here for anyone to discuss these points further with me. Great video btw!,comment,7년 전,22000,1339905,702000,5년 전(수정됨),2025-11-27,마이크로서비스 아키텍처 디자인,0.62674534

"마이크로서비스 아키텍처란 무엇이고, 어떤 장점이 있나요?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYhRvH9tJKw&pp=ygUs66eI7J207YGs66Gc7ISc67mE7IqkIOyVhO2CpO2FjeyymCDrlJTsnpDsnbg%3D,Uploader(Desc),"마이크로서비스는 시스템 설계 면접에서 중요한 주제입니다. 모놀리식 시스템 대신 마이크로서비스를 사용하는 이유를 아는 것이 중요합니다. 간단히 말하면 확장성입니다. 자세히 설명하면 다음과 같습니다.

장점:
1) 마이크로서비스 아키텍처는 복잡한 시스템을 추론하고 설계하기가 더 쉽습니다.
2) 새로운 구성원이 더 짧은 기간 동안 학습할 수 있고, 시스템을 사용하기 전에 더 적은 맥락을 가질 수 있습니다.
3) 각 서비스에 대한 배포가 유동적이고 지속적입니다.
4) 비즈니스 책임에 따라 서비스 로직을 분리할 수 있습니다.
5) 단일 서비스에 버그가 발생해도 전체 시스템이 중단되지 않으므로 가용성이 더 높습니다. 이를 단일 장애 지점이라고 합니다.
6) 각 서비스를 여러 언어로 작성할 수 있습니다.
7) 개발 팀은 동일한 저장소에서 작업하는 대신 API 시트를 통해 서로 소통할 수 있으며, 이는 충돌 해결을 필요로 합니다.
8) 새로운 서비스를 쉽고 개별적으로 테스트할 수 있습니다. 테스트 구조는 모놀리식에 비해 단위 테스트에 가깝습니다.

마이크로서비스는 경우에 따라 모놀리식보다 불리합니다. 다음과 같은 경우 모놀리식이 유리합니다.
1) 기술/개발자 팀의 규모가 매우 작은 경우
2) 서비스 전체를 이해하기 쉬운 경우
3) 네트워크 호출을 최소화하여 서비스 효율성을 극대화해야 하는 경우
4) 모든 개발자가 모든 서비스에 대한 맥락을 파악해야 하는 경우

Microservice - It's a division of whole works into business units which are turned into specific microservice. 

Adv Monolith:
- Less moving parts
- Good for small teams 
- Less duplication for tests etc
- Faster because everything is in same box(procedure calls)

Disadv Monlith:
- Require more context
- Deployment is complex (everything is touching every other thing)
- Too much responsibility on one server (one can break everything)
- Tight coupling 

Adv Micro:
- Easy to scale
- Less context required
- Parallel development is easy 
- Less hidden parts(more resources can be provided where it is required)

Disadv Micro:
- Tougher to design

Most of the times interviews are high scale and hence micro service is preferred

My 2 cents :)
Monolith Advantage / Microservices disadvantage.
1. Transaction management.  
2. One does not have to deal with multiple technology stacks.
3.There is no need to maintain code at the same level for all the services. 
   You don't need to pass on a jar to other services in order to enable resue of code.
4. Latency (as mentioned in the video)


Microservices advantages
1. No single point of failure.
2. You can use the correct technology stack for the required microservice.
3. Decentralized architecture.
4. Decentralized data management.
5. No need to redeploy the whole application. Deployment is faster and easier.
6.Your microservices should be designed across products. SOA is designed around features. This way of thinking is more customer centric.",comment,7년 전,17000,790547,702000,6년 전,2025-11-27,마이크로서비스 아키텍처 디자인,0.56884015

Monolith is a single application build for many systems.
In Monolith if any modifications done in the code the whole application should be build and deploy. In case of my microservices only the modified microservices will be deployed.
Monolith uses local calls for interaction where as microservices will use network calls. So here Monolith will give better performance as compared to microservices.
Testing will be easier in microservices because we  test only modified microservice .
In case of Monolith if any changes done need   to perform the functionality testing of whole application to make sure application is working as expected.",comment,7년 전,17000,790547,702000,6년 전,2025-11-27,마이크로서비스 아키텍처 디자인,0.56884015

M#2 code generation is evil []
  (just a tech)
M#3 event log must be the source of truth []
  (ok to record service own record)
M#4 <= 3 services/developer []

Flow Platform Architecture []
API Definition []

Definition in Git, with Continuous Integration []
Tests Enforce Consistency []
Tests Prevent Errors []
API Implementation Supported by Code Generation []
Code Generation: Routes []
Code Generation: Client []
Code Generation: Mock Client []
Now Let's Implement []

Database Architecture []
  Each micro service application owns its database
  No other service is allowed to connect to the database
  Other services use only the service interface (API+Events)
Create a Database []
Define storage requirements in metadata []
Code generation: Create a Table []
Code generation: Scala Class []
Automated Tests []
Test Resource Operations []

Time to Deploy []
Continuous Delivery []
Continuous Delivery (git) []
Continuous Delivery is Critical []
Auto Deploy on New Commit on Master []
Microservice Infrastructure - keep it simple []
Standard Health Checks []

Events []
Principles of an Event Interface []
  First class schema for all events
  Producers guarantee at least once delivery
  Consumers implement idempotency

Software architecture for a web application is essentially the blueprint for how a web app is structured. There's monolithic architecture, where you basically piled everything into a single, tightly coupled codebase. But if you want to efficiently scale your app from 100 users to 100,000 users, or want to ensure adding a line of code to a certain component or feature doesn’t break the entire application, then you may want to take a look at the microservice architecture. In the same realm, there's serverless architecture. There's also a higher level of architecture: client-server and peer-to-peer.
When it comes to web app architecture, there are so many different types & many of which aren’t even exclusive from one another. So I’ve broken these down, put them into levels that are actually comparable, and created explanations in a way for you to simply understand the different types of web app architecture, why they’re important, how they play into software development, and given your requirements, goals, and possibilities, which app architecture is best for your app. I hope this helps. Enjoy!

1. Test, test, test! There's coding for 5 hours with no checkpoints in between to test the implementation and functionality.
2. As others have pointed out, MySQL and MongoDB should have been also services in the cluster instead of instances on the local machine. This kind of defeats the purpose of 'microservices'. Either go the whole way or not at all.
3. The file handling (upload and download), should also be separate services. The API gateway responsibility should be to only relay the message from the client to the correct service endpoint. E.g.: user logs in, API gateway calls the auth service. user wants to upload/download, API gateway calls the file_handling service, etc.

But great nevertheless. I hope to see more of these high-level, project-based, system design tutorials!",comment,3년 전,13000,563413,11300000,11개월 전,2025-11-27,마이크로서비스 아키텍처 디자인,0.77605915

I wish only you’d start building Python modules with unit tests instead of testing the code manually. Also, I noticed you’re tagging your containers after the build by copying the build reference into the terminal.  One way of simplifying your workflow with containers is to add the tag command right to the build like so: “docker build . -t repo:tag1 -t repo:latest”. Your great educator and a lot of inspiration.

마이크로서비스 면접 질문과 답변 | 아키텍처 설계 및 모범 사례,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0waumbpK48&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBSzrp4jsnbTtgazroZzshJzruYTsiqQg7JWE7YKk7YWN7LKYIOuUlOyekOyduA%3D%3D,@infomahboobali,"Micro Services Interview Questions

01. so tell me what do you understand by microservices?
Ans: microservice basically decoupling of entire application into small small services. like if I take an example of Amazon or Uber or like you can say any application. so like take example of Amazon okay so in Amazon we'll have like many partners like seller then we will have buyers and at the end we'll have like persons from Amazon who will be managing all the applications or like we'll be seeing the transactions and every other details so we will mention it as an admin so this is an entire application say suppose it is written in Java so what happen is like if I need to change something like in buyer I need to change a small like I want to give an offer of 5% so what I need to do I need to write the code and deploy the entire application so instead of this we can use microservice based architecture where the seller will be a single application buyer will be another application and the admin would be another application so here what happen is like if the admin is down or like if the server is down the entire Amazon website is down so but in this case if admin is down people can use the buyer option or like if the seller is down seller will not be able to add any further items to his store but the buyer can able to check out from his cart and or you can add anything from other sellers or which are already in the stores and if suppose I want to change something in seller and want to deploy, so will just go and deploy this application and the seller what happened is like it may be written in Java it may be written in .net it may be written in node.js so you.

02. so you said that it is a decoupled architecture so coming to that can you explain what are the major differences between service-oriented architecture or monolithic application and a micro service?
Ans:  so what happen is like as I already told that in service-oriented architecture or monolithic application is the entire application so the application monolithic application is the whole block of application service layer or SOA service-oriented architecture is like we define small small module but inside the same application only so we make it modular wise like we take the part of if you take the example of Java we created packages we create interface for particularly for DAO a particularly for seller particularly for customer and particularly for admin and in micro service what we have is like we'll have more granular level of breakdowns like in seller also we can have different types of sellers like from us we can have the part for us only which will be running on any servers on us or we can have clients of any other applications who will be interacting with or auth layer for particularly sellers and auth layer for particularly admin 2 different applications we can have so all these are completely segregated and talked to each other in like over an HTTP and not throw the application himself so if I draw an example like monolithic  SOA and if I take the example of micro service I can say like microservice and there can be N number of microservices okay now I will give you 

03. two scenarios first design a simple micro service architecture application and the second scenario is migrate the existing monolithic application to microservices and what will be your means approach or whatever your thought process to break down those into small small micro services like you took example of Amazon right so you can just show how Amazon can or if you are owner of Amazon that particulars software so how you would have broken it into small small micro services so how I design a micro service is like if it is a new application 
Ans: as you already told since it is a new application so I'll just take the requirements so I will ask like who are the users what are the existing schema how the relationships are mapped like like what are the dependencies like I can have like buyers and sellers so both are actually correlated we can't segregate it out completely so the database, how will manage the databases and all so if I take example of buyer and seller only so buyer will have its own name ID and like items so we have three tables and seller will have like cart details and items brought so these means different tables so this item and this item is related so it is like it can't be like I have brought here like a pan and the buyer doesn't sell a pen or any of the buyers doesn't sell any pen so it it is related so how it interact is like I will call this and suppose he brought already one item or added it so it it will get deleted from here and it will be added here so this is how but these things are completely independent these and these are completely independent so we can keep it out and build two microservices micro-service one and microservices yeah this is how means generally we define micro-services for if I am going for a new application and say it is database and this is database and how we will break a micro surface actually this is a long term process it doesn't work so quickly or so nicely so what we can do is like in monolithic application there we need to change the existing application also side by side and there are micro services so suppose we have buyer-seller and we want to take this out and make it as a micro service so what we can do is like instead of buyer calling this we need to have like a mechanism to call an API so admin will also be there residing and API for admin also and it will point to this micro service so we'll build this micro service we'll take this part this is business logic from here and put it here and once it is done then we'll just point it out instead of calling this we will now call this and instead of calling this we will now call this so this is how we break down so we need to take care of similarly the table structure I mean the schema and we need to means slowly and gradually we need to take these and map so it's like a long term process 
04. while breaking those micro services what so it's like a long term process so while breaking the micro services what are the advantages you have and what are the drawbacks while using all this micro service based architecture
Ans: so the main advantages of micro service is like earlier I told that we will deploy okay so how will define is like a we have buyer then we have seller and we have admin so like Independently we can deploy independently we can make the code change so it's fault tolerant like if it goes down it will be up it will be up then what else one more thing is like we can expand it like we can scale it so like independently we can have entire admin then admin and we can have a load balancer to navigate the traffic and one more thing is like as its mainly practiced by Netflix so like an individual contributor or an individual developer will take like the requirement then he will deploy he will make the code changes then he will deploy it in like cloud or any server independently so he takes a complete responsibility smaller tasks and more thing and one more thing is like it can be written in Java it can be written in node.js so there is no like dependence on any particular technology so anyone can use any technology this is the main criteria so the main problem is like we can have multiple layers of authentication like micro service one is talking to micro service to micro service 3 then it is talking to individually they are talking with each other then micro service 4 the micro service 5 and suppose like so first of all we need to have individual deployment strategy for each one and suppose if something goes failed here so we need to find out we need to find the root cause or why it got failed so we need to debug all the stages here and why it got failed you need to check and on the top of that we need to have multiple layers of authentications, so for micro service 3 it may able to access few of the applications or few of the API so this one will give like auth this one may have authorization type 2 so here we need to implement multiple types of authorization means like for each one individual applications we need to give multiple layers of authentication or authorizations 

05. so you have hierarchical of micro services like micro service one and micro service 2 is talking to micro service 3 suppose which is an auth layer and the micro service 3 is talking to some other micro services like 4 and 5 respectively so if something goes wrong like in micro service layer third or layer 4 something went wrong so how you will know that that micro Service is failing and you need to debug that micro service application logs?
Ans: so to answer your question suppose I have multiple layers of micro services so what we can do is like we can traffic all the logs to Splunk or Kibana or we can say elasticsearch and for each request we can generate a correlation ID so this correlation ID would be passed through each of the headers and it will be logged in the Splunk or like elasticsearch and like suppose if anything goes wrong with this request we can later take out that request and see okay how we can process it from the backend so that's how and if something suppose this server went down so we can have a health check to look for all the servers and suppose this went down the health check will return to the Kibana or email notification like that we can have",comment,6년 전,8900,457046,19700,5년 전,2025-11-27,마이크로서비스 아키텍처 디자인,0.63396555

Small confusion u took the same example for both SOA and MicroServices. Well said, MicroServices uses smallest possible independent Unit which can be easily modified and deployed. In your example - SOA Buyer module can be further be converted in to Customer-MS1, AddressAndDeliveryAddress-MS2   CommunicationDetails-Normal&ForOrderTracking-MS3 - Here Buyer module can be further divided in to smaller units - Tomorrow if delivery related any extra requirements comes then in that case AddressAndDeliveryAddress-MS2 will get effected and Customer-MS1 will be untouched. I am not sure my example suits in this case or not - I am just adding one more example for better understanding purpose.


Disadvantages of MicroServices not covered- 
                             When it will be difficult to manage 
                             How many maximum number of MS can an product can have, if huge number what are possible challanges, What kind of mechanisms will help to fix dependent issues when you have more and more microServices you have.


Which sectors are not suitable

MicroServices are not suitable for Finance sectors and few other where hudge number of business rules which are interrelated and huge data modifications and data depedndencies.

It is easy pick for CDN, videostream, social media networking related where data is not frequently changing and hence you can bring up more smaller units effortlessly and which becomes easy maintenance and also easy scaling for required ones",comment,6년 전,8900,457046,19700,5년 전(수정됨),2025-11-27,마이크로서비스 아키텍처 디자인,0.63396555

1. 카프카는 데이터 무결성을 보장하는지? 
2. 데이터 위변조를 막는 방법을 갖고있는지? 갖고 있다면 어떤 방법으로 가능한지?
3. 데이터 저장지 용량 관리는 어떤식으로 해야하는지?

Hello everybody I'm Nick and in this video I will show you what I think is the best way to reset your database to a clean state, every time you run a test. This works great with integration testing but other forms of testing can use the same technique.

Resetting back to a previous point and resetting back to a clean, EMPTY state are two very different things.

So does it actually reset back to a previous point or does it just empty the tables you tell it to empty?",comment,3년 전,1900,67511,379000,2년 전,2025-11-27,TestContainers 통합테스트,0.51787317

The solution limits the number of total databases that can be spun up. I find it to be pretty quick and allows tests classes to be run in parallel which is helpful becase we have 1000+ integration tests.

However, if I didn't need parallelism and was looking for an easy to implement solution, Respawn definitely seems like a good option. Thanks for the info!",comment,3년 전,1900,67511,379000,3년 전,2025-11-27,TestContainers 통합테스트,0.51787317

We are going to use Testcontainers to spin up a PostgreSQL database in a container and use that for our tests. We will write a Repository test and a Controller test that calls the repository that talks to our database.

Integration testing is a testing approach that tests the integration between multiple components. Usually, this will involve a database, so you can test your query logic. Docker is an excellent tool for creating throwaway databases for your integration tests. And you can make it even better with the Testconatiners library. It allows you to programmatically create your docker containers for integration testing.

It is of my understanding that the database that is available within your docker did not run any migration prior to the execution of your integration tests. Perhaps, in the WebApplicationFactory's ""InitializeAsync"" method, there should have some code lines that fetch the ApplicationDataBaseContext service, then execute the "".DataBase.Migrate"" method on it.

They provide programmable, lightweight, and disposable containers to give you more confidence in your integration tests.

Getting started with Testcontainers is straightforward, but there are many advanced features to supercharge your test suite.

In this session, we’ll look at Testcontainers in more detail and answer the following questions:

What’s the best way to debug what happens in a container?
How do we build more complex topologies of services?
What’s the best way to migrate from Docker Compose?
How can we use Testcontainers for local development in addition to integration tests?
What is reusable mode and why is everyone talking about it?
Whether you’re a practitioner with solid test coverage or just beginning your journey into writing more reliable software, this session will introduce you to Testcontainers and its capabilities!

Functional testing is a testing approach that tests your system functionality from a client's perspective. It's also called End-to-End (E2E) testing. In a typical ASP.NET Core APi, functional testing involves calling the API endpoints. You also want to use real external service to make your tests mimic a production environment. Docker is an excellent tool for creating throwaway databases for your functional tests. And you can make it even better with the Testconatiners library. It allows you to create throwaway docker containers for functional testing. I'll show you how to implement functional testing in this video.

SpringBoot provides excellent support for integration testing using @SpringBootTest annotation.

Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

Testcontainer allows us to use Docker containers within our tests. As a result, we can write self-contained integration tests that depend on external resources.

엔비디아도 깜짝 놀랄 초거대 계산 반도체가  나옵니다 (KIST 초거대계산반도체전략연구단 구현철 단장),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzpIK-IiPNk&pp=ygUe66y866WYIOy1nOygge2ZlCDrrLjsoJwg7ZW06rKw,Uploader(Desc),"본 영상은 국가과학기술연구회의 제작지원을 받았습니다

📌내용 요약
 국가과학기술연구회와 언더스탠딩이 공동으로 진행하는 과학 대중화 프로젝트 첫 번째 편에서는 초거대 계산 반도체 전략 연구단 구현철 박사가 '초거대 계산 반도체'에 대해 설명했습니다.
 기존 CPU와 GPU의 연산 방식(순차적, 병렬적 계산)으로는 복잡한 조합 최적화 문제를 해결하는 데 한계가 있으며, 이에 대응하기 위해 '랜덤 컴퓨팅(확률적 컴퓨팅)'이라는 새로운 접근이 필요하다고 강조합니다. 랜덤 컴퓨팅은 진정한 난수 발생을 기반으로, 문제의 정답을 직접 찾기보다는 정답일 가능성이 높은 후보군을 빠르게 제시하는 방식입니다. 이를 위해 자연계 기반 난수 발생 장치와 새로운 형태의 반도체 칩 개발이 진행되고 있습니다. 이 기술은 신약 개발, 기후 예측, 물류 최적화 등 고차원적 문제 해결에 적용될 수 있으며, 양자 컴퓨터와 비교해 상온 동작, 기존 반도체 공정 활용 등의 장점이 있다고 설명했습니다.

🔑핵심 주제
CPU·GPU 방식의 한계: 기존 컴퓨팅 방식으로는 조합 최적화 문제를 풀기에 계산량과 비용이 과다하게 발생함.
랜덤 컴퓨팅의 개념: 난수를 기반으로 정답 후보를 확률적으로 빠르게 도출하는 새로운 연산 방법.
진정한 난수 발생의 중요성: 편향 없는 난수 발생이 정확한 결과 도출의 핵심이며, 자연계 현상 활용 필요.
초거대 계산 반도체 개발 목표: 특정 문제를 효율적으로 풀기 위한 전용 칩 개발 중, 5년 내 실용화 목표.
응용 가능성: 신약 개발, 기후 예측, 물류 최적화, 금융시장 예측 등 고난이도 문제 해결에 활용 기대

AI와 고객 서비스 에이전트가 함께 작업할 수 있는 방법,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC-I7qzw3TI&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBQpBSSBDbyBXb3Jr,@godsunoriginal2060,"The bottom line is artificial intelligence should replace all customer service in stores and security in stores. Artificial intelligence can be used to Ring up items whether they were brought up to the register or items in a person's pocket that was taken off a shelf , And artificial intelligence can be hooked directly to the security system/ camera system and accurately determine if a person was stealing, and Artificial intelligence could notify the police if the person does not pay for the items when they get to the register or self-checkout. Also the robots don't discriminate as humans often believe certain types of people are stealing as soon as they come into the store or that those people are planning to steal artificial intelligence won't do that which means there will be much less false police reports and false accusations put on people especially minorities. Also people won't have so many limitations on shopping like not being allowed to come in a store with a bag, because artificial intelligence will be watching diligently. This also ends altercations occur because of poor customer service or even if the customer service person was correct they still can't argue and fight with other humans. Stores are Robbed and vandalized because of poor customer service and discrimination by other humans. They should replace as many humans as possible except for in the case of the military you don't want a I somehow having a program defect that causes it to bomb the whole human population with nuclear weapons or something or any other kind of bombs. Also a robot is indifferent to a person calling it names or telling it to hurry up it just does its function unlike a human who will be angered or do something irrational. Artificial intelligence will also save business owners money so that they don't have to hire so many employees especially of these robots are programmed to be diligent workers. Customer service officials in stores are not elevating the human life to a beneficial degree or making some good contribution to society as a whole they are actually part of the problem that contribute to the degradation of humanity. And they could get jobs that contribute more to helping the human society become better and more advanced and more comfortable. Less people will have to fly Jets and pollute the air less people would drive cars and pollute the air, because it will reduce the traffic to and from work because it will be less people working those jobs. We don't have to get rid of jobs that actually contribute to society like teachers but a I would be a good addition to those jobs although it is possible that way I could replace some of those jobs because there are some very poor teachers out there if I can remember even having racist something that artificial intelligence will stop as but like said we are some ways off from that. I typed this using auto voice so I did not actually type this if there are any errors in spelling it was a AutoVoice mistake, nonetheless I am a actual person.",comment,2년 전,15,509477,40599,2년 전,2025-11-26,AI Co Work,0.5975431

• Focus on problems: Early on, Scale AI focused on the narrow problem of self-driving cars (8:19).
• Be aware of market size: Focusing on self-driving cars enabled quick scaling, but wasn't a large enough market to sustain a gigantic business (9:51).
• Generate data for AI applications: To be successful in any vertical area, AI needs data, so demand for those products would precede the evolution of AI into those industries ().
• Find repetitive human workflows: Identify repetitive human workflows and convert that into data sets that enable building automation tools ().
• Care: The biggest thing is you just have to really, really, really care ().",comment,,0,314820,0,5개월 전,2025-11-26,AI Co Work,0.5292548

There might be more roles in AI, like machine learning engineers, but overall, competition is extremely high across the entire tech industry. Everyone is fighting for fewer positions, and the interview processes have become super tough.

No thx…
I have a job and freedom (I work where- and whenever I want ;)))

* Which type of work cannot be replaced by AI and is the best-paid???

AI strategist-philosopher (a “Renaissance Man”), because this person sets the direction and implements the entire transformation in the world (holistically: culture, science, mentoring, etc.).

How much would they earn?

I estimate up to 10 billion/ year.
But there is also a paradox- such change takes a lot of time, so it becomes an auction (“the pioneer’s advantage”; we currently have a “blue ocean theory,” meaning that whoever “positions themselves correctly” at the beginning will be setting the rules for the next 50- 100 years, just like it was with BMW/ Mercedes/ Siemens/ etc.).",comment,4개월 전,3400,159670,1430000,10일 전,2025-11-26,AI Co Work,0.5474904

My suggesstion:
Actual result is not necessary. If test case is failed you will be changing the status of it. Once bug fixed, u will retest the test case and change the status to pass.
Test case name is missing in this.
Test description - by the name we can understand that it should be descriptive. So elobrate the test case description.",comment,8년 전,29000,2220957,166000,5년 전(수정됨),2025-11-26,Testcase Management System,0.53205997

스크린샷을 사용하여 수동 테스트 케이스를 자동으로 생성하는 방법 | Testcase Studio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJfJMcR7vEw&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRZRQSDrpqztj6ztirgg7J6Q64-Z7ZmU,Uploader(Desc),"Testcase Studio는 Sanjay Kumar가 개발한 혁신적인 확장 기능으로, 테스트 케이스 자동 생성 프로세스를 간소화합니다. 고급 기능을 통해 사용자 단계를 자동으로 기록하여 수동으로 테스트 케이스를 생성할 필요가 없습니다. 수동 테스터든 자동화 테스터든 테스트 케이스를 작성하게 됩니다.

테스트 케이스 작성은 시간이 많이 소요되는 작업입니다. 하지만 Testcase Studio는 코딩 지식이 전혀 필요하지 않습니다. Testcase Studio는 사용자의 작업을 기록하고, 필요한 단계를 지능적으로 캡처하여 스크린샷과 함께 완벽하게 작동하는 테스트 케이스로 변환합니다.

이러한 단계를 활용하여 버그를 제기하는 동안에도 테스트 케이스를 제작할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 테스터와 개발자 간의 효율적인 소통이 가능해져 버그 해결 속도가 향상됩니다.

Testcase Studio를 사용하면 귀중한 시간을 절약하고 전반적인 생산성을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.

Embrace: Modern mobile observability built on OpenTelemetry,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do4FSvlsbhc&pp=ygUNT3BlblRlbGVtZXRyeQ%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"“What’s up with the mobile app?” For many engineering teams, this is a dreaded question—exposing gaps in visibility between backend and mobile teams.

Backend engineers focus on server health, while mobile engineers are often in a silo, lacking the right tools to diagnose complex issues. Communication becomes a barrage of notifications with no unified view of the problem. Mobile has been the missing piece—until now.

Meet Embrace.
✅ Open-source SDKs for mobile observability
✅ Enriched data & powerful analysis dashboards
✅ Built on OpenTelemetry for complete data portability
✅ Captures crashes, errors, memory issues & full user sessions

🔎 See Embrace in action:
1️⃣ A backend engineer spots checkout latency in Grafana (or any backend).
2️⃣ They identify that the mobile workflow is slowing down.
3️⃣ Mobile engineers use Embrace to dive into the session timeline and find the culprit.
4️⃣ The team fixes it fast—boosting app performance and user satisfaction.

It’s time to elevate user experiences and modernize observability with Embrace. Let’s embrace the future of real user monitoring together.

However, last couple of videos felt over-filled, and it felt like you rushed through the content just to get through all of it, instead of explaining everything like you used to. If one does not have personal experience with any of the stuff you present, it is very easy to feel left behind and not understand anything.

OpenTelemetry(OTEL)를 사용하여 코드를 계측해야 합니다!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe5YYh9mhzw&pp=ygUNT3BlblRlbGVtZXRyeQ%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"애플리케이션 동작에 대한 통찰력을 얻으려면 코드를 계측해야 합니다. 하지만 코드 계측에는 시간과 노력이 많이 들 수 있으므로 특정 도구에 얽매이지 않는 방식으로 수행하는 것이 좋습니다. 바로 이러한 이유로 Open Telemetry는 로그, 메트릭, 추적 정보가 수집되는 도구와 관계없이 계측 표준을 제공합니다.

Been paying for tutorials, searching high and low... Thanks for putting this together beginning with testing a most BASIC function that returns only a string concatenated value. This is what I've been looking for!!!

The one thing I don't see anyone doing (neither professionally nor in any demonstration) is to combine debugging with unit testing functions. My biggest benefit to TDD is to setup the expectation prior to writing the function and write the function to satisfy that. That way, I am testing mostly functions only and, by the time it's completed to satisfaction, the test enforces the outputs from the function. The test is done and the function is done. I do not understand why more developers do not work this way.",comment,7년 전,9900,399258,929000,2년 전(수정됨),2025-11-26,AI E2E 테스트,0.6134969

Looks like life just got easier for the visually impaired, because AI is testing websites like it’s blind too.",comment,5개월 전,1100,108788,27300,3개월 전,2025-11-26,AI E2E 테스트,0.54440576

AI-Driven Test Automation with Playwright + Cursor + MCP Server,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNh3_r6UjKk&pp=ygUQQUkgRTJFIO2FjOyKpO2KuA%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"In this tutorial, we show QA engineers and developers how to build a complete Playwright test automation framework in Python using AI. We integrate the Playwright Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server with Cursor IDE to generate a full framework (using the Page Object Model design pattern for maintainable, scalable test code) entirely through an AI prompt – no manual coding required. You’ll see how to go from initial setup to running real browser tests in one seamless flow, using AI to speed up development.

Flask + React 프로젝트 생성 방법 | Python 백엔드 + React 프런트엔드,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LNl2JlZKHA&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRVBSSB4IEZyb250LUVuZCDsvZTrlKk%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Hey guys, welcome back. In this video, I will show you guys how to set up a project with a Flask backend and a React frontend. We will set up a backend API with Python that returns an array of members and in the frontend, we will fetch that backend and display the same members onto the frontend.

If you don't know what Flask is, Flask is a Python-based web framework that is used to create web applications. It is a microframework, which means that it does not provide many of the features that larger frameworks do. Flask is designed to be extended and customized, and it can be used for web development in both production and development environments.

If you don't know what React is, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and Instagram. React's declarative, efficient, and flexible nature make it an ideal choice for building user interfaces.

I highly recommend learning state management, Redux, MobX before learning react native.

And pick one framework like React and learn it so well you can land a job. There's plenty of jobs that look for each framework so choose one and master it rather than trying several.

Also, the extra time spent on deeply learning JavaScript would pay off more.

My stack is Next.js, React, JavaScript, CSS, Sass, Stylus and I've written my own CSS library.

React Native is awesome but it's a whole new learning curve beyond frontend development. I'd suggest learning it in the job or after work rather than before you ever land a job.

If you can do state management in React applications and handle data flow from the back-end and APIs you will get a job over anyone who cannot. All big companies need you to understand state or you won't be very useful.

Learn design patterns in React and JavaScript.",comment,1년 전,18000,540771,4870000,6개월 전,2025-11-26,AI x Front-End 코딩,0.56296027

https://interviewready.io

틴더의 시스템 아키텍처를 설계합니다. 앱 설계는 시스템 요구 사항을 명확히 하는 것부터 시작됩니다. 면접에서 틴더는 여러 가지 요구 사항을 가지고 있습니다.

시스템을 설계할 때는 마이크로서비스 아키텍처를 기반으로 논리적 구성 요소를 도출하고 다른 서비스와의 상호 작용을 정의합니다. 내부 세부 사항은 시스템 설계 개념에 대한 사전 지식을 통해 처리할 수 있다고 가정합니다. 여기에는 부하 분산, 메시지 큐, 데이터베이스 등이 포함됩니다.

틴더 시스템은 프로필 저장, 추천, 매칭 기록, 매칭 상대와의 채팅이라는 네 가지 요구 사항을 가지고 있습니다. 프로필 저장은 이미지 저장을 제외하고는 간단하며, 이미지 저장에서는 BLOB와 파일 저장에 대한 논쟁이 있습니다. 이미지를 저장할 때는 분산 파일 아키텍처가 가장 적합합니다.

다이렉트 메시징이나 매칭 상대와의 채팅은 XMPP 프로토콜을 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다. XMPP 프로토콜은 웹 소켓을 사용하여 클라이언트와 서버 간에 P2P 통신을 수행합니다. 각 연결은 TCP 기반으로 구축되어 연결이 유지됩니다. 세션 마이크로서비스는 사용자 매핑 연결을 기반으로 수신자에게 메시지를 전송할 수 있습니다.

저희 시스템은 최대한 분리되어 있습니다. 클라이언트에서 수락 및 거부 정보를 유지하려고 노력합니다. 왼쪽이나 오른쪽으로 스와이프할 때 클라이언트는 해당 동작을 기록하고 블룸 필터를 사용하여 동일한 사용자를 다시 표시하지 않을 수 있습니다.

서버에는 매치 마이크로서비스라는 검증 엔진이 있으며, 이 엔진은 매치를 기록하고 두 사용자 간의 채팅을 허용 또는 거부합니다.

추천의 마지막 요건은 사용자 데이터를 도시별로 분할하는 것입니다. 이는 Cassandra나 Amazon Dynamo와 같은 NoSQL 데이터베이스를 사용하여 구현됩니다. 다른 옵션은 수평 분할을 지원하는 관계형 데이터베이스를 사용하는 것입니다. 이 개념을 샤딩이라고 합니다.

의문점, 제안 또는 피드백이 있으시면 아래에 남겨주시기 바랍니다. 이 시스템은 아직 완벽하지는 않지만, 한 시간 분량의 인터뷰를 진행하기에는 충분합니다.

면책 조항: 본 영상에는 Tinder의 내부 구현이 포함되어 있지 않으며, 이를 암시하지도 않습니다. 저희가 디자인한 시스템은 순전히 상상의 산물일 뿐이며, 실제 앱과는 아무런 연관이 없습니다. 틴더 엔지니어들이 이보다 더 나은 시스템을 만들어냈을 거라고 확신합니다!

Hello everybody I'm Nick and in this video I will show you what I think is the best way to reset your database to a clean state, every time you run a test. This works great with integration testing but other forms of testing can use the same technique.

The solution limits the number of total databases that can be spun up. I find it to be pretty quick and allows tests classes to be run in parallel which is helpful becase we have 1000+ integration tests.

I don't reset my integ test database at all. What I do instead is I generate a unique test key (an integer) for each test. I do that using a special ""TestExecution"" table with an identity column. I insert a record into this table at the beginning of each test, then get the value of the identity column from the inserted record. Once I have a test key, I use it to construct names of my domain objects. For example, all tests that create a Customer object would use $""Test Customer {_testKey}"" as the name. This avoids data collisions between tests and eliminates the need to reset the database after each test.",comment,3년 전,1900,67507,379000,3년 전,2025-11-26,TestContainers 통합테스트,0.51787317

We are going to use Testcontainers to spin up a PostgreSQL database in a container and use that for our tests. We will write a Repository test and a Controller test that calls the repository that talks to our database.

Integration testing is a testing approach that tests the integration between multiple components. Usually, this will involve a database, so you can test your query logic. Docker is an excellent tool for creating throwaway databases for your integration tests. And you can make it even better with the Testconatiners library. It allows you to programmatically create your docker containers for integration testing.

They provide programmable, lightweight, and disposable containers to give you more confidence in your integration tests.

Getting started with Testcontainers is straightforward, but there are many advanced features to supercharge your test suite.

In this session, we’ll look at Testcontainers in more detail and answer the following questions:

What’s the best way to debug what happens in a container?
How do we build more complex topologies of services?
What’s the best way to migrate from Docker Compose?
How can we use Testcontainers for local development in addition to integration tests?
What is reusable mode and why is everyone talking about it?
Whether you’re a practitioner with solid test coverage or just beginning your journey into writing more reliable software, this session will introduce you to Testcontainers and its capabilities!

SpringBoot provides excellent support for integration testing using @SpringBootTest annotation.

Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.

Testcontainer allows us to use Docker containers within our tests. As a result, we can write self-contained integration tests that depend on external resources.

Preventing Deep-Level Documentation in Spring REST Docs

When developing with Spring, it's common to utilize tools like Spring REST Docs to create documentation for your REST APIs. However, one challenge developers face is the generation of excessively deep-level documentation for request bodies. This can lead to convoluted and hard-to-read documentation output, hindering the clarity and effectiveness of your API reference. In this guide, we’ll address this common problem and provide a solution that keeps your API documentation clean and easy to understand.

The Problem: Deep-Level Documentation Output

Consider the following Spring controller method designed to edit a resource:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

Such a method can lead to request body documentation resembling the following:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

This output can quickly become unwieldy, especially when dealing with nested objects. The documentation's deep nesting makes it difficult for consumers of your API to grasp the necessary information without wading through excessive details.

The Solution: Using @  RestdocsNotExpanded Annotation

Fortunately, Spring REST Docs provides a straightforward solution to this problem. By utilizing the @  RestdocsNotExpanded annotation, you can customize your documentation to prevent the propagation of deep-level field expansions. Here’s how you can implement it in your project:

Step 1: Annotate Your DTO Fields

For every field in your Data Transfer Object (DTO) that you want to keep at a shallow level, simply annotate it with @  RestdocsNotExpanded. Here's an example of how to structure your DTO:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

By applying @  RestdocsNotExpanded to the childs field, you effectively instruct Spring REST Docs not to delve deeper into its structure when generating documentation.

Step 2: Update Your Test Method for Documentation

In your test methods, you can continue to document your API as you normally would, without worrying about deep-level field expansions:

[[See Video to Reveal this Text or Code Snippet]]

This way, your output will remain concise and only reflect the level of detail that you want to expose, eliminating the nested child fields that can clutter your documentation.

Conclusion

Maintaining clarity and accessibility in your API documentation is crucial for its usability. By employing the @  RestdocsNotExpanded annotation, you can easily configure Spring REST Docs to prevent the deep-level documentation of nested fields in request bodies. This not only improves the readability of your documentation but also enhances the overall experience for developers interacting with your API. Happy documenting!

It would be fantastic if we could have a comprehensive course on industry-standard frameworks like Angular, .NET Core, and React. Imagine learning to combine Angular for the frontend, .NET Core for the backend, and Workbench for the database to build enterprise-level projects. This hands-on experience would help us master these frameworks, from RESTful API development to seamless frontend-backend communication. It's a skill set that's in high demand in the industry, and it would give us a competitive edge in our careers.

Both the backend and frontend part are correct. Just one thing to add, in kotlin things like coroutines etc are important, you may skip using it in app(when you see online videos, they choose the easy path) but you must implement these things, there are many ways to pass data in flutter, but you must use the most effective one, and not just get done with the easy ones. Remember companies will ask you the efficient ones because no company will compromise on that. Always deploy your app on store, make the app not just like a project, but like an end user application keeping user experience in mind and fixing such bugs. Try to be great at ui look and feel, keep the api based backend secure and fast. 2 great projects on resume and well prepared for interviews will land you in a good company.",comment,2년 전,66000,2165273,7280000,2년 전,2025-11-26,PHP Development Roadmap,0.4939065

#redis #database #techworldwithnana

In this Redis crash course, we're going to talk about Redis and how Redis can be used as a primary database for complex applications that need to store data in multiple formats.
1) First we will see what Redis is and its usages as well as why it is suitable for modern complex
microservice applications. 
2) We will talk about how Redis supports storing multiple data formats for different purposes through its modules.
3) Next we will see how Redis as an in-memory database can persist data and recover from data loss.
4) We'll also talk about how Redis optimizes memory storage cost using Redis on Flash.
5) Then we will see very interesting use cases of scaling Redis and replicating it across multiple geographic regions and 
6) finally since one of the most popular platforms for running microservices is Kubernetes and since running stateful applications in Kubernetes is a bit challenging, we will see how you can easily run Redis on Kubernetes.

Thanks so much for making a video on Redis. You can really see how much time and effort went into this.
- Just enough content to give you a complete introduction that’s not too long but doesn’t leave so many unanswered questions that you have to watch similar videos that might repeat 40% of the content
- Question-answer style presentation where questions used are the ones you would have when beginning and in the middle of starting to use it
- Attractive visuals which helps watchers more easily understand concepts but also implicitly keeps them engaged by helping them follow along the video better
- Clear logical explanations that also use analogies and references people will likely understand to help bring new knowledge into existing knowledge",comment,3년 전,13000,529638,1360000,2년 전(수정됨),2025-11-26,Redis Test,0.5693985

The reason I find it so impressive is because even though it is a Redis crash course, you didn't get into basic syntax and setting up Redis which I usually find in other videos and can be done easily with documentation.

자율 AI 에이전트 - 왜 여러분이 만들어야 하는지... 그리고 어떻게 만들어야 하는지.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4teb28H2i70&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRbsnpDsnKggQUkg7JeQ7J207KCE7Yq4,,"CORRECTIONS

I sometimes have to post corrections to videos, so I use pinned comments (this thing here) so people see it.

I got a lot of pushback on my comments about Python, so I do want to clarify what I mean:

For new people who are just starting to learn how to code, the whole process is daunting and the learning curve is steep. You have to figure out IF you need to learn to code, WHAT language to learn, WHICH dev tools to use, college or online... the list goes on and on.

I think this stops a lot of people just due to decision fatigue alone.

My goal was to make it so simple that people would be kicked into action. Just ""LEARN PYTHON. USE GOOGLE COLLAB"".


Once people start coding and building useful applications, then can start expanding their knowledge, add other languages etc. The learning process is addicting and will carry them further.

Only 0.5% of the world can code!

We need to get more people to start learning to do it.

So for people just starting to code and interested in AI:
JUST LEARN PYTHON

In the past year, I have been constantly ""injesting"" information about AI from a HUGE amount of sources, some good, some bad, I have made a lot of experience building with AI and I have been thinking about autonomous agents for a while. I believe that I made myself a pretty solid idea of the ""quality"" of the sources, and it made me much quicker at learning.

That being said, I can confidently say that this is a really well done video, you know what you are talking about, and you realise where AI is going. It's also incredibly inspiring and well thought.
When I need inspiration, I will probably come back to this.

I started by choosing a topic, and then I asked A and B to come up with ideas for improvement. Both chatbots generated ideas, and then I asked them each what they thought about the other's idea. Finally, I asked A and B to consider each other's ideas and come up with a new idea by fusing the two together.

The outcome was amazing. This is the future of brainstorming! You can even instruct the chatbots to be experts in different fields, such as A being a teacher and B being an engineer.

After a couple of hours in the project conversation all that can go totally off track and it’s as though GPT 4 decided to take a break and it’s dumb brother got behind the wheel instead as it starts failing to understand the simplest of prompts.

👉    • A Custom AI Agent Framework  

SUMMARY ⤵️
Over the last 18 months, I've been building autonomous AI Agents. They used to suck, but now they're so good that we fully believe it's time for every business to embed them within their processes.

Just so we're clear...
↳ I don't know how to code
↳ I'm not an ""AI Engineer""
↳ I just want to use AI to make more money for my business...

WHY ME?
If this is your first watch—hi, I’m 👋 Devin! TLDR: I spent the last 18 months building AI Agents, AI Applications, and AI Automations. Today a lot of people talk about AI Agents, but I’ve noticed that very few have practical, real world success integrating them into their businesses. So this channel is me showing you how to build useful AI Agents that can operate your business 24/7 - allowing you to focus on the activities that will actually lead to growth.

It exudes intelligence, and I will definitely watch other videos from you. My takeaway is that there is a lot of work to be done by non-coders around thinking about what their workflows are and how they are enabled by different tools or subtasks and how to lay these tools / tasks down on a piece of paper and connect them. The one area that still prevents me from embarking on that journey is the lack of familiarity with a lot of the tools you mention in your video and the lack of time in my day to both do my job as well as take time to automate it.

Autonomous AI has been just an idea, and I hadn't seen anything that actually worked. But now, we have an autonomous AI agent that actually does, and it's kind of scary how good it already is. You tell it what you want it to do, and it uses your computer to complete the task like organising your email inbox, replying to people, booking flights, ordering groceries without you even lifting a finger. It's still slow and there are limits to what it can do. But it's scary how quickly AI is evolving.

If we're using AI to do some task 'better,' it means whatever that task is (ordering pizza, booking a trip, etc.) the processed sucked to begin with.  When companies figure this out, wouldn't they escalate their experiences, perhaps build in their own AI functionalities, to make performing such a task 'better' than what it is now?

🎬 영상 주요 포인트

🖥 서버 vs 클라이언트 개념
사실 '서버'란 말은 역할의 개념이에요.

...

한 컴퓨터가, 네트워크로 연결된 
다른 하나 이상의 컴퓨터들에게 뭔가를 해주면

이를테면
저장된 글과 사진, 영상들을 보여주거나
반대로 그것들을 업로드받아서 보관해주거나

한 컴퓨터가 톡을 보내면 
다른 컴퓨터에게 알림을 보내거나

위치정보와 목적지를 받고 
가는길과 소요시간을 계산해주거나

여럿이 온라인으로 참여할 수 있는 
게임을 열어주거나

하면, 그 해주는, serve하는 컴퓨터가 서버,
그 service 받는 컴퓨터가 서버의 상대 개념인
손님, 클라이언트가 되는거에요.

...

한 맛집 앱을 담당하는 컴퓨터가 있어요.
이 컴퓨터는 앱이 깔린 폰들에 
맛집들의 정보를 전송해줘요.

폰들에 서비스를 제공하니까 서버인거죠.

-

그런데 이 앱이 
특정 지역의 지리 정보가 필요할 땐

이 컴퓨터가 네이버 지도 서버에
요청해서 정보를 받아와요.

이때는 이게 클라이언트가 되는거죠.

이거 마크서버에 사용하시는 분 한국에서 되게 드문걸로 아는데
보게 되니 반가워서 추가적인 부연 설명 들어갑니다 ㅋㅋㅋ
간단히 원리를 설명하자면 여러분이 인터넷으로 유튜브 보는 원리입니다
아래는 긴글입니다



일반적인 방화벽에는 인터넷으로부터 나한테 들어오는 행위인 ""인바운드""와
내가 인터넷으로 나가는 행위 ""아웃바운드""의 2가지의 동작에 대한 규칙을 정의합니다

이 영상에 나오는 벽 LAN을 사용하는 서버 이용시 기본적으로 타인이 접속할 수 없는 이유는
인바운드 부분에 문제가 있기 때문입니다
물론 방화벽이 막는 것은 아니고 그보다 상위에 있는 NAT가 인바운드 요청을
어디로 보내야하는지 모르기 때문입니다
결론적으로는 접속이 불가하다는 상황이 동일합니다

Q. 어? 근데 내가 집에서 유튜브 영상 보는건
데이터를 밖에서 받아오는 행위 아닌가요?
A. 정확합니다. 그것이 이 리버스 프록시의 원리입니다

통신 규칙인 tcp의 제일 큰 특징은 수신된 데이터에 대해서 항상 응답을 한다는 것입니다
그리고 아웃바운드로 나간 연결에 대한 응답은 요청을 보냈던 호스트로
제대로 전달해주는 것이 기본적인 동작입니다

간단히 말하면 외부에서 요청이 바로 들어오는 것은 경로를 지정해줘야 하지만
내가 먼저 요청하고, 이후 응답이 날아오는 것에 대해서는 알아서 수신한다는 것입니다

이걸 사용하신 서버에 매핑을 해보면
벽 LAN을 사용하는 본체서버 S
들어올 유저분들 C
프록시 서버 P가 있습니다

C----P----S 의 구조가 되는데
여기서 P가 S에 먼저 연결 시도를 하는 것이 일반적인 프록시의 동작입니다

근데 S는 인바운드를 받을 수 없는 상태죠?

여기서 S가 P에 먼저 아웃바운드로 연결 시도를 한다면요?
그에 대해서 P가 S에 응답을 해줄 수 있겠네요

그렇다면 P가
C로부터 온 데이터를 S에 응답하는 김에 같이 보내고
S로부터 온 데이터를 C한테 전달 해줄수도 있을겁니다

이것이 리버스 프록시이고 그걸 go언어 기반으로 간편히 쓸 수 있도록 구현한 것이
영상속의 FRP입니다. 이거 아주 맛도리니 여러분 꼭 써보세요",comment,2개월 전,1900,53874,1360,2개월 전(수정됨),2025-11-26,게임 서버 개발,0.44269493

저는 오래되어 쓰지 않고 있던 i5 8265u 노트북에 리눅스 민트를 올리고 fabric dedicated server를 돌리고 있습니다. 유명한 linux distro 중에 linux mint가 정말 이상할 정도로 전력을 조금밖에 쓰지 않는다는건 꽤 유명하거든요. 서버가 켜져 있고 접속자는 없는 상태, 즉 idle시, 소비 전력이 6w 정도밖에 되지 않으니, 상설서버를 돌려놓기 정말 이상적이었죠.

구동중인 서버가 모드서버라, 사실 부하 문제 때문에 기기 교체에 대해 많은 고민을 했습니다. 초당 20틱보다 아래로 떨어지지는 않지만, tick sprint가 불가능한, 딱 턱걸이 상태로 구동되는 상태였기 때문인데요. 그 때문에 서브컴으로 놀려두고 있던 ryzen 3600 pc에 동일한 세팅으로 서버를 구동해 보았는데, 수치상으로 확인되는 싱글코어 성능 차이에 비해 실체감 프레임 차이는 거의 없더군요. 그런데 전력소모 적으로는 이야기가 많이 달랐습니다. 부하가 걸리는 상태에서의 전력소모는 비슷했지만, idle시 전력소모는 6배에 달했거든요. 압도적으로 낮은 idle시 전력소모를 이유로, 부하 피크시 프레임 방어는 약간 포기하고 전성비 쪽을 택하게 되었었습죠.

저전력 개인용 서버 cpu로 유명한 n100도 고려 대상이었고, n100의 싱글코어 성능이 8265u보다 약간이나마 더 좋은것도 사실이라 꽤 구미가 당기는 옵션이었지만, 모드서버의 경우 멀티코어 오프로딩을 잘 해 주는 최적화 모드가 많아 싱글코어 성능보다 멀티코어 성능이 좀 더 중요하고, 거기서 8265u의 더 많은 코어 수가 장점을 가지더군요. n100으로 가려면 장치를 새로 사야 하기도 해서, 여러모로 8265u 모드서버가 제가 취할 수 있는 옵션 중 가장 좋은 옵션이었습니다.

하지만 n100으로 서버 기기를 선택했을 때의 가능성을 대리로 본 것 같은 느낌이라 대단히 흥미로웠습니다.

그 와중에 한가지 질문이 있습니다. dedicated server에는 자체적인 화이트리스트 기능이 있을 겁니다. 모든 유저가 마인크래프트 정품 사용자라면 포트포워딩과 방화벽 인바운드 룰, 그리고 자체적인 화이트리스트 기능만으로 개인 서버 수준에서는 충분한 보안이 달성 가능할 터입니다. 그런데 굳이 복잡하게 리버스 프록시를 선택하신 이유가 있으신가요?

솔직히 단순하게 생각하자면 그냥 서버 멤버 중에 복돌 유저가 있어서 그렇다고 보는게 제일 자연스럽다고 생각하지만, 만약 전원이 정품유저인데도 리버스 프록시를 택하셨다면, 저도 배워가야 할 필요가 있어 보여 여쭙습니다. 사실 개인 아이피를 노출한 상태로, 포트포워드로 외부망에 포트 하나가 노출되어 있는 상황이 안전하다고 생각되진 않거든요.",comment,2개월 전,1900,53874,1360,2개월 전,2025-11-26,게임 서버 개발,0.44269493

If your software interacts with external APIs, you need to know concurrent programming. I show you how it works in Python and then take it to the next level by showing advanced concurrent features such as using async with generators and comprehensions, show a simple way to turn blocking code into concurrent code, and then I cover how concurrency affects software design and architecture.

db마다 원자적 연산 지원 여부, 지원하는 쿼리 형태를 어디에서 확인하면 되나요?
mysql 같은 경우 테스트해봤을 때 지원하는 거 같은데, mysql 사이트에서 해당 내용이 안보입니다.


[내용]
update article set readcnt = readcnt+1 where id =1; 와 같은 특정 형식의 쿼리만 지원을 하는 건가요? 아니면 지원하는 쿼리 형태가 여러개 있는건가요? 
그리고 db에서 실제로 원자적 연산을 지원하는 지 확인해야 된다고 해주셨는데요.  db 사이트에서 확인해보면 되는 걸까요?

mysql atomic operation
mysql cursor stability
로 검색해보기도 하고
아래에서 찾아봤는데 일치하는 내용이 안 보여요.( 영어를 잘 못해서 못 찾는 걸 수도 있습니다.)


java, spring boot, jpa, mysql 환경에서 테스트해봤을 때 update article set readcnt = readcnt+1 where id =1;  형태로 쿼리 날려보니까 멀티쓰레드 코드에서 변경 유실 발생 안 하고 동시성 처리가 됩니다.

함수형 프로그래밍이 어려운 이유 (사고의 전환 등 배울 가치 충분),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGfXE7Gf3QE&pp=ygUZ64-Z7Iuc7ISxIO2UhOuhnOq3uOuemOuwjQ%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"함수형 프로그래밍(functional programming)을 배우는 과정에서 겪는 경험과 깨달음을 다룹니다. 그 도전과 보상을 둘 다 설명합니다.

하스켈(Haskell)이나 엘릭서(Elixir) 같은 함수형 언어를 배우며 겪은 어려움은 다양합니다.

순수 함수와 불변성과 같은 이점을 인식하면서도 함수형 프로그래밍(FP)의 독특한 사고방식과 추상적인 개념들이 어렵게 느껴집니다.

명령형 프로그래밍 습관을 버리는 일과 모나드(monad) 같은 복잡한 개념을 이해하는 어려움을 설명합니다.

함수형 프로그래밍은 작성 코드의 명확성 향상과 더 나은 추상화 방법을 제시해 줍니다.

그리고 함수형 언어의 특성상 동시성 프로그래밍에 적합할 수 있습니다.

함수형 언어의 학습 곡선은 가파르지만, 그 과정을 통해 얻는 코딩 통찰력을 얻게 됩니다.

이 결국 더 나은 프로그래머로 성장하게 해줍니다.

이번 영상 주요 논점입니다:

1. 어려움 1: 불변성(immutability)과 상태(state) 관리. 이는 프로그래밍에 대한 근본적인 도전입니다.

2. 어려움 2: 프로그램 흐름을 다루는 새로운 방식으로 반복문(loop)이 없습니다. 함수형 프로그래밍(FP)은 다른 사고방식을 요구합니다. 불변성(immutability)과 명령형 언어의 반복문 대신, 고차 함수(higher-order functions), map, foldr, 재귀(recursion) 등을 사용하는 흐름 제어 방식을 채택합니다.

3. 어려움 3: 추상적인 개념들 (모나드, 고차 함수 등). 함수형 언어 핵심 개념들 때문에 도전적으로 느껴질 수 있습니다. 모나드와 같은 추상적인 개념들이 처음에는 혼란스러울 수 있습니다. 함수형 프로그래밍은 순수 함수를 통한 코드 품질 향상을 도모합니다.

4. 기타 어려움: 에러 메시지, 피드백. 불변성 덕분에 버그는 줄어듭니다.

5. 보람 1: 순수 함수로 향상되는 코드 품질. 함수형 프로그래밍(functional programming)을 배웠을 때의 보람(reward)를 설명합니다.

6. 보람 2: 불변성을 통한 버그 감소

7. 보람 3: 향상된 추상화와 유지 보수성

8. 보람 4: 동시성(concurrency)과 병렬 처리(parallelism)에 유리함

9. 보람 5: 프로그래밍에 대한 더 깊은 이해. 프로그래밍 원리와 패러다임에 대해 깊이 생각하게 합니다.

10. 논평: 도전 가치가 있는 프로그래밍 여정. 이러한 함수형 언어가 요구 하는 새로운 사고방식과 특징들은 함수형 프로그래밍을 완전히 사용하지 않더라도 프로그래밍의 이해도를 깊게 만들어 줍니다.

에러처리와 결과처리입니다.

에러처리는 사실상 validation에 가깝고
타겟한 현상계를 표현합니다.
절대법칙의 틀을 간단하게 적는거죠.


마지막으로 가장 중요한건
결과처리 식을  return 한줄에 담는겁니다.

이걸 하지 못하고 있다면 그건 함수형 프로그래밍이 아닙니다.

그 전에 있던 모든과정이 이걸 위함이니까요

이게 아니면 함수형 프로그래밍이 아닙니다.

자 이제부터 함수가 아닌 프로그램 단위에서 보도록하죠.

결론적으로 우리는 함수형 인터페이스로 프로그램과 비즈니스 로직을 구축 할 수는 있지만 100% 함수형 프로그래밍은 절대 불가능합니다.

기본적인 Sort 조차 함수형 프로그래밍이 아닙니다

왜 일까요? 수학과 그 안의 함수는 
자연을 표현하고자 한겁니다.

그런데 정렬 같은것은 인간이 자신의 기준에 따라 인위적으로 나열해서
표현하고자 했습니다.

이건 수학이 아니에요. 자연법칙도 아니구요.

기준 순서 절차 제도 인간이 만든 개념입니다.

for문이요? map? filter? if? reduce?
모두 동일합니다.

인간이 정의하고자 표현하는것들은
수학도 아니고 함수도 아니에요

절차 제도등으로 자연현상을 가둬 자신들의 예측 범위 안에 두고 통제하기 위함입니다.

이건 절대로 함수형 프로그래밍으로 구현할수 없구요.

금융계도 마찬가지입니다.

일단 도입부터 선형적이지 않은 범주의
변수들 즉 우리는 문자열에 대해서
 if 혹은 case처리를 해야합니다. 여기서 끝이죠 
함수형이 아닙니다. 절차형이죠

우린 코어 및 util 디렉토리 정도에서나
함수형을 유지할수 있습니다.

사실 프로그래밍에서 가장 중요한건
인간의 기준과 자연의 기준을 구분하고
섞이지 않도록 하는겁니다.

특히 자연계 함수내부에 인간계 절차 함수를 쓰면 절대 안됩니다.
인간계 절차함수로 자연계함수를 끌고와야죠.

인간계 함수 비즈니스로직에는
절차형과 재현형이 있는데

재현단계 함수에서 자연형 함수 잘 가져다 쓰시는게 능력입니다.

재현도 사실 자연형 함수는 안쓰는 경우가 많아서 유틸형 함수에서 많이들 가져다 쓰시죠.

This course covers functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow programming in a unified framework.

Register for Paradigms of Computer Programming from LouvainX at http://www.edx.org/courses. 

About this Course

This course gives an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow. We explain the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. We present declarative dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and show how it avoids race conditions. We give a simple formal semantics for all concepts and illustrate them with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System. This course is targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.

multiple types of custom locks,  and customizable callbacks. and you are FUCKED
std::lock doesn't help much. it's for locking all of the locks at the same call -_-
sometimes(in my case, all of the time), for better performance, you don't want to lock anything until it is needed. and that will be decided by the information extracted from the previously locked stuff. and they are supposed to do this, in separate places.
also, the problem of not doing timeouts : you will be less afraid of deadlocks, and therefor not detect them at early stages. you may end up with a bad data structure",comment,8년 전,44,2626,213000,6년 전(수정됨),2025-11-26,동시성 프로그래밍,0.522655

#cloud #concurrency #programminglanguages #ndcoslo #ndcconferences #developer #code 

Modern cloud-based applications are composed of countless concurrent, distributed processes pushing traditional programming models past their breaking point.

Distributed Async Await, a new programming model for the cloud, extends the simplicity of async-await to tame the complexity of the cloud. Building on the foundations of functions and promises, Distributed Async Await enables “simple code that just works”.

In this talk, we will explore the theoretical and practical foundations that makes this elegant approach possible. Gain a comprehensive understanding of async-await, functions, promises, and the vital concepts of concurrency and coordination in distributed systems. Take away actionable insights on how to replicate the delightful developer experience of traditional applications as you craft cloud-based, distributed applications.

Design and develop cloud applications that are not only scalable and reliable but downright delightful to work on. Transform the way you approach cloud computing.

Angular 서비스를 사용하여 컴포넌트 간 데이터 공유 | Angular 15 마스터하기(고급) | 강의 33,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrjcThJCj5A&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBSbtj7wg642w7J207YSwIOq0gOumrCAo7ZSE66Gg7Yq47JeU65OcKQ%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Angular is a popular front-end web development framework created and maintained by Google. It is an open-source framework that uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern.
Some of the features and capabilities of Angular include two-way data binding, dependency injection, components, directives, pipes, routing, and testing.
Angular provides a seamless way to synchronize data between the model and the view. Any changes made to the model are automatically reflected in the view and vice versa.
Angular uses a dependency injection system that helps to manage and organize code more effectively.
Angular applications are built using reusable and modular components that can be easily combined to create complex user interfaces.
Directives are special attributes that can be added to HTML tags to provide additional functionality, such as hiding or showing elements based on certain conditions.
Pipes are used to transform data in templates, such as formatting dates or converting text to uppercase.
Angular provides a powerful routing system that allows for easy navigation between different views in an application.
Angular has built-in support for testing, making it easy to write and run unit tests for your application.
Overall, Angular is a powerful framework that enables developers to build complex, scalable, and performant web applications with ease.

Kotlin에서 구조화된 동시성을 사용한 우아한 리소스 처리,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrTBH8jqH4&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRBLb3RsaW4g64-Z7Iuc7ISx,Uploader(Desc),"Modern programming often requires us to guarantee how our applications terminate. One way to do this is through structured concurrency, which allows us to reason about parallel processes and how they relate.

In this session, we will learn how to use Arrow’s Resource Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to reason about resource safety, like we use structured concurrency to avoid leaking resources. We will also see how this can be combined with KotlinX Coroutines to build complex use cases and elegantly use Kotlin DSLs.

I needed this as I'm getting back into pfsense again. Played from 2016ish to Dec 2019 with a functional machine as my home router. I moved right before Covid and didn't have control over the internet in the new place. Anyways, I'm just a novice enthusiast user and I'd like to request for your ""pfsense to pfsense"" video... one of my main goals was to build a portable pfsense (with AP) box I could plug in at a family member's/friend's house or hotel that connects to my home pfsense (via VPN), ideally automatically, so its just like I'm on my home network and have access to everything without having to configure all my traveling devices individually (which I don't mind doin). But would love that all-in-one solution partly to build and learn but also convenience or to get around hotel restrictions/control.

1:39 - Benefits of Using Wireguard
3:00 - Best VPNs that Use Wireguard
*********************

Simply put, Wireguard is a free, open-source VPN connection protocol that has proven to be faster, simpler and more lightweight than other encryption protocols. 

If that doesn’t make sense to you - and don’t worry, you’re not alone - think about this: OpenVPN, which is currently considered the security standard for VPN protocols, runs on 600,000 lines of code. IPSec, another standard VPN protocol, has 400,000 lines of code.

Wireguard runs on 4,000.

That’s a 99% reduction in code, which has made it much easier to manage as well as to debug. In this case, simpler is definitely better. Not to mention that this represents what is considered to be a stronger encryption method.

Over the next few minutes, I’m going to explain how Wireguard works, the benefits of using Wireguard, and finally the best VPN services that are now running the Wireguard protocol.

I’ll start by saying that Wireguard was initially developed back in 2016 as an alternative connection protocol for the Linux operating system.

What we’re dealing with here is a way to encrypt communication between two devices, which could be your computer and your corporate network, a server and a machine, your phone and the cellular network...whatever.

This is important when passing sensitive information across the open internet. There are already a lot of encryption measures in place, but a virtual private network or “VPN”, adds an additional layer of security.

But what makes Wireguard so special when we have perfectly good protocols we can use already?

It can really be boiled down to three things:

First, Wireguard creates a stable connection faster than previous protocols. I’ve already seen this myself in multiple cases where it takes less than 1-2 seconds to establish a connection through Wireguard when it normally takes between 5-10 seconds using OpenVPN.

It can also switch from mobile networks to WiFi networks without dropping, which is a huge benefit.

You see, the old connection protocols were designed decades ago and have been slowed by all the over-engineering that has taken place to make them meet different needs.

Second, Wireguard has been tested to perform up to 4 times better than OpenVPN and IPsec-based VPNs. That means you can get up to 4 times faster speeds when you’re connected to the VPN, which if you’ve used a VPN for any period of time, you know how important that is.

Finally, Wireguard utilizes modern cryptography that has been peer-reviewed and promoted by numerous security experts. All VPN protocols provide a level of security, but only Wireguard takes advantage of new methods such as cryptokey routing.

For you, the user, the only thing that really matters is that the VPN protocol connects quickly, stays connected and gives you fast connection speeds.

Now, unless you’re incredibly tech savvy and feel comfortable setting up your own virtual private network at home, most of us are going to be using a commercial VPN that has integrated Wireguard into their applications.

Ubiquiti Insider: UniFi Network 7.3 | ISP 디자인 센터 | EV 스테이션 [2022년 11월],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0gm1xLscFU&pp=ugMICgJrbxABGAHKBRtXaXJlR3VhcmQgVlBOIOyEnOuyhCDqtazstpU%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Welcome to Ubiquiti Insider, where we share insights into the latest Ubiquiti R&D advancements. 

Let’s start with UniFi’s expanded VPN experience: For an absolute no-hassle VPN setup, we have invented something we call Teleport.  Just launch the WiFiMan app on any smart device anywhere in the world and connect.  It’s that simple.

And if you’re a power user that still prefers a traditional VPN Server setup, we have you covered with the faster performance of WireGuard, now also in 7.3

Finally, what if you just want a single device on your network always connected to VPN?  Perhaps a TV connected to Switzerland? No problem! Simply create a Traffic Route and use the new VPN client bridging feature to direct traffic for a specific device to anywhere in the world.

Moving on to our security advancements: Our expanded system log now provides admins with powerful event tracking of their deployments. From session activity, to configuration changes, UniFi’s system log provides timestamped details along with a fully customizable push notification system.

We’ve also updated UniFi Talk and our line of Touch and Touch Max Phones, enabling greater customizability with a pin-protected Lock Screen, scheduling for your status, wallpapers, and the ability to assign specific ringtones to contacts. Additionally, we introduced an intercom feature, and the ability to send and receive SMS with your Talk numbers so you can interact and engage with your contacts in more ways. Finally, make sure a call is always answered with Ring Flow, where you can customize a ringing sequence for your incoming calls. And with the ability to set a Failover Redirect Number you can protect against any service interruptions. 

USIP and ISP Design Center now work together to make link planning even easier. In UISP Network, simply click on the ISP Design Center icon on the map and your network will be seamlessly integrated into ISP Design Center. From here, you can import a UISP network from your account or a self-hosted application so you can quickly plan and simulate coverage for new customers, and continue expanding your network.

And with the Profitability Calculator you can see a detailed financial analysis of your imported network, adjust your subscriber count and simulate different internet plans to see when you can expect to reach profitability. Start designing your deployment: https://ispdesign.ui.com

We announced the WiFiman Wizard, a new battery-powered Spectrum Analyzer that connects via bluetooth to your smartphone and brings spectral magic to your WiFiman App, unlocking incredible insight to help you build better wireless experiences.

We introduced the UniFi EV Station, the world’s first EV charging platform specifically designed for organizations. And with the UI mobile app, organization members can start charging their electric vehicles with a single touch of a button.

We also introduced our first product within UniFi Mobility, the UniFi Mobile Router, a compact LTE router that can be instantly set up to provide reliable Internet in any environment – even on the move.

초보자를 위한 Framer 완벽가이드 10단계 | 초고퀄 | 프레이머무료강좌,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4u_8uYQ0_w&pp=ygUg7Y6Y7J207KeAIOyjvOyGjCDslaDri4jrqZTsnbTshZg%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Framer 페이지 바로가기: https://guidebean.com/framer
Framer 가이드 페이지: https://guidebean.com/framer-ai-guide/

처음 Framer 를 배우려는 초보자분들을 위해 프레이머 사용법을 준비했습니다. 프레이머는 코딩없이 노코드로 애니메이션을 포함한 다양한 인터렉티브한 고품질 웹사이트 제작 툴입니다. 캔버스에서 그림을 그리듯이 제작하는 방식으로 제대로 배운다면 누구나 창의적인 자신만의 홈페이지 만들기가 가능합니다.

이 영상에서는 데모 프레미어 랜딩페이지를 10단계를 통해 단계별로 직접 따라하며 제작하게 됩니다. 프레이머 AI 기능도 있지만, 이를 제대로 활용하려면 사용법부터 익혀야 제대로 제작이 가능합니다. 그러므로 이 가이드 강의를 통해 기본 사용법을 제대로 배우시기 바랍니다.
이 가이드는 Framer 제휴마케팅 활동의 일환으로, 이에 따른 일정액의 수수료를 제공받을 수 있습니다. 이는 추가 비용을 발생시키지 않으며, 높은 품질의 가이드 영상을 무료로 제공하는데 큰 도움이 됩니다. 감사합니다.

특수기호나 상형문자 같기도 한 이 마크를 ‘QR코드’라 한다. QR은 ‘Quick Response’의 약자로 ‘빠른 응답’을 얻을 수 있다는 의미이다. 인디자인에서는 무척 간단하게 OR 코드를 만들 수 있습니다. 스마트폰으로 쇼핑몰의 특정한 상품 페이지, 이벤트 페이지로 소비자들을 안내할 수 있는 방법입니다.

"Alexandr Wang: Building Scale AI, Transforming Work With Agents & Competing With China",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5noIKN8t69U&pp=ygUKQUkgQ28gV29yaw%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Alexandr Wang started Scale AI to help machine learning teams label data faster.

It started as a simple API for human labor, but behind the scenes, he was tackling a much bigger problem: how to turn messy, real-world data into something AI could learn from. Today, that early idea powers a multi-hundred-million-dollar engine behind America's AI infrastructure—fueling everything from Fortune 500 workflows to real-time military planning. 

Just last week, Meta agreed to invest over $14 billion in Scale, valuing the company at $29 billion.

Alexandr joined us on the Lightcone to share how Scale evolved from a scrappy YC startup into the backbone of some of the world's most advanced AI systems, how he thinks about competition with Chinese AI labs, and what it takes to build infrastructure that shapes the frontier.

• Focus on problems: Early on, Scale AI focused on the narrow problem of self-driving cars (8:19).
• Be aware of market size: Focusing on self-driving cars enabled quick scaling, but wasn't a large enough market to sustain a gigantic business (9:51).
• Generate data for AI applications: To be successful in any vertical area, AI needs data, so demand for those products would precede the evolution of AI into those industries ().
• Find repetitive human workflows: Identify repetitive human workflows and convert that into data sets that enable building automation tools ().
• Care: The biggest thing is you just have to really, really, really care ().",comment,5개월 전,5300,314820,2070000,5개월 전,2025-11-26,AI Co Work,0.5292548

Tom Gruber, co-creator of Siri, wants to make ""humanistic AI"" that augments and collaborates with us instead of competing with (or replacing) us. He shares his vision for a future where AI helps us achieve superhuman performance in perception, creativity and cognitive function -- from turbocharging our design skills to helping us remember everything we've ever read and the name of everyone we've ever met. ""We are in the middle of a renaissance in AI,"" Gruber says. ""Every time a machine gets smarter, we get smarter.""

When a doctor is responsible for diagnosing cancer he will try his best and reach a success-rate of 96.6 %. If you design a machine that does the job almost as good as a human there is a chance that the doctor doesn`t FEEL the significance of own skills and RELYS on the machine to do the job. Why use my own brain to sum up numbers when i can use a calculator? Why remember how to write a difficult word when I can just use auto-correct anyways? 

As far as I know humans perceive the world based on what's important to them. I don't remember the name of my neighbours great grandmother because it's not relevant to me. If we mess with our information-filter I fear there is a danger of not being able to make decisions anymore, maybe even developing an identity disorder?

I’ve talked to around 300 people working in tech, and the reality is that big companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta are still doing layoffs. The market is really unstable, and landing a job now is much harder than before.
There might be more roles in AI, like machine learning engineers, but overall, competition is extremely high across the entire tech industry. Everyone is fighting for fewer positions, and the interview processes have become super tough.

No thx…
I have a job and freedom (I work where- and whenever I want ;)))

* Which type of work cannot be replaced by AI and is the best-paid???

AI strategist-philosopher (a “Renaissance Man”), because this person sets the direction and implements the entire transformation in the world (holistically: culture, science, mentoring, etc.).

How much would they earn?

I estimate up to 10 billion/ year.
But there is also a paradox- such change takes a lot of time, so it becomes an auction (“the pioneer’s advantage”; we currently have a “blue ocean theory,” meaning that whoever “positions themselves correctly” at the beginning will be setting the rules for the next 50- 100 years, just like it was with BMW/ Mercedes/ Siemens/ etc.).",comment,4개월 전,3400,159585,1430000,10일 전,2025-11-26,AI Co Work,0.5474904

Recent AI agents that my company implemented made these tasks even more easy and I can do even more sophisticated strategic planning and velocity tuning with suggestive data insights.

이쪽의 종착지는 TA가 되는 경우가 많아서 언제나 코딩에 관심이 있었습니다.
근데 얼마전에 GPT에게 일하다 불편한 부분을 코딩 시켜보고 많이 놀랐어요
진짜로 개발자에게 부탁하지 않고도 스스로 처리 할 수 있게 된 거죠

바이브 코딩으로 배운다고 진또배기 개발자가 못되는 건 아닌 것 같아요
저는 AI에게 코드를 받고나서 항상 이 코드를 전부 초등학생에게 설명하는 것과 같이 쓰인 기능과 연산에 대해 자세히 설명해달라고 하거든요
그러면 기능과 연산 같은 지식들을 학습 할 수 있게되고, AI가 실수 하더라도 배운것들을 떠올려 이렇게 하면 되지않아? 하면서 다시 시키거나 직접 수정을 할 수 있죠.
또 AI가 한번에 처리 못하는 코딩은 만들고자하는  것을 파악해서 부분부분 시킬 수 있게 되구요.

예전에 코딩 기초라고 해서 처음부터 시작하면 텍스트출력 만들고.. 계산기 만들고..
도저히 이걸 응용해서 어떻게 게임 개발에 응용하냐 싶어서 진도가 안 나갔던 것들이 한번에 해결 됐습니다.

논문쓰다가 데이터 너무커지고 그거 분석하는거 너무 시간많이걸리는데 그런곳에 쓰는 프로그램은 없고... 그러다 시도해본게 ai로 코드짜서 쓰니까 넘 편해서 아예 프로그램으로 만드는데 하나도 모르는 상태서 하다보니 하나하나 만드는데 문제해결에 조금 시간이 많이 걸리더라구요. 어디서 문제 발생하는지 계속 실행하면서 생각 계속해서 여기가 문제아니냐 저기가 아니냐 이렇게 접근하면 안되냐 이런식으로 접근 했어요. 다른 ai모델한테도 물어보고 서로 참고? 하게해서 고치고 조금씩 만들어가고는 있는데 확실히 기본 공부가 안되 있으니까 느려요 디버깅에서도 시간 많이 걸려요. 코드 하나하나 처음부터 배워서 만들기에는 또 시간이 많이 걸리니 이렇게 하고 있는데 뭔가 하다보니 어디서 명령을받아 어디로 넘어가고하는지 감? 을 조금씩 잡긴하더라구요. 사용자와 상호작용이 정말 어렵더라구요.. ㅜ 내가 쓰면서 버그나 이런거 다 찾으면서 해보니까 애착 없으면 제대로 버그 못 찾을거같아요. ㅎㅎㅎ

어차피 기존 Gemini 모델을 기반으로 한다면, 환각 발생 수준도 기존 모델과 유사할 것 같기는 한데.. 원래라면 딥리서치 결과를 사람이 검토한 뒤 다음 단계(이미지·영상 생성)로 넘어가는 과정에서 잘못된 정보를 걸러낼 수 있었을텐데, 이번 방식은 그런 검증 절차가 없다보니 초기에는 작은 환각이었던 것이 최종 결과물에서는 큰 오류로 확대될 가능성도 있어보이네요. 
hallucination이 생겨서 결과가 이상해지면 전체 시나리오를 다시 돌려야할텐데 사용량이 어느정도까지 될지도 궁금합니다.",comment,3개월 전,6100,174819,214000,3개월 전,2025-11-26,바이브 코딩,0.5355289

Google's Gemini 3.0: The Most Powerful LLM Ever,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og7R9C_N3Zg&pp=ygUQ67CU7J2067iMIOy9lOuUqQ%3D%3D,Uploader(Desc),"Get a private, on-screen walkthrough of Google’s new Gemini 3.0 with Logan Kilpatrick from Google Deepmind. We vibe-code full apps, games, and product UIs in real time. You’ll see how to go from raw idea to working product in a single prompt, then iterate visually with design, features, and AI workflows. They turn an IdeaBrowser concept into a live talent-matching platform, screenshot-clone the IdeaBrowser UI, wire up a “generate tomorrow’s idea” feature grounded in Google Search, and even add co-founder matching on top. If you’re building with AI or still on the fence, this episode shows what’s now possible with Gemini 3.0 Pro in AI Studio.

00:00 – Intro
01:00 – What Gemini 3 is and where it lives (Gemini app, AI Studio, API)
03:03 – Vibe Coding 3D games
09:27 – Vibe Coding an idea from IdeaBrowser
25:02 – Screenshot-cloning the IdeaBrowser UI and regenerating it in Gemini

Key Points
Gemini 3.0 Pro in AI Studio lets you “vibe code” full apps—UI, logic, and AI features—from natural-language prompts, then iteratively refine them.
Games and complex simulations are a stress-test and showcase for the model’s capabilities, not just toys.
You can paste an entire business idea (like IdeaBrowser’s generational talent-matching concept) into AI Studio and get a working, multi-screen product with AI-powered workflows.
Gemini 3.0 Pro is free to use inside AI Studio up to generous limits, and the API is priced at $2 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens under 200K input tokens.
Screenshot-driven UI cloning plus “add five more features” prompts are powerful loops for product and UX ideation.
You can layer social features like co-founder matching directly on top of idea-discovery products with only a few additional prompts.
Section Summaries

1) Why Gemini 3.0 Is an “Unfair Advantage”
Greg frames the episode as an inside look at Google’s new Gemini 3.0, promising listeners a practical “unfair advantage” in how to use it. Logan explains Gemini 3’s mission—helping you “bring anything to life,” from receipts and papers to app ideas—and outlines where it’s available: the Gemini app, AI Studio, and APIs for developers and enterprises. 

2) Vibe Coding Landing Pages and Games
Inside AI Studio’s vibe-coding experience, Logan shows that a single prompt can generate polished landing pages and immersive 3D games. They discuss games as both marketing assets (e.g., branded runners for companies) and as a proxy for the model’s sophistication, since game logic and UX are hard to build by hand. 

3) Turning an IdeaBrowser Concept into a Working App
Greg introduces an IdeaBrowser concept: a generational gap talent-matching platform pairing junior AI developers with senior industry veterans. Logan copies the idea’s full text into AI Studio and asks Gemini to “make it fully functional,” resulting in a live app with landing page, talent profiles, fit analysis, and an enterprise team-builder that evaluates roster balance. 

4) Debugging, Annotating, and Deploying Vibe-Coded Apps
As they explore, they hit common vibe-coding friction points: a mis-placed “Send” button and a blank preview due to missing files. Logan demonstrates the annotate tool (boxing UI elements and attaching instructions) and the simple fix of telling the model “the screen is white” so it regenerates the correct structure, then describes how you can deploy, share, and iterate on these apps with teammates or customers. 

5) Screenshot-Cloning IdeaBrowser and Generating Tomorrow’s Ideas
They screenshot IdeaBrowser’s UI and ask Gemini to “clone this UI exactly” while adding a “generate tomorrow’s idea” button grounded in Google Search. The model recreates a close visual match and builds a feature that pulls current AI governance trends to generate a new idea (“Ethos AI”) with positioning, offer, and starter kit concepts—showing how screenshots become launchpads for new verticals or geos.

It might SORT-OF work, and be KINDA-LIKE what you want, but when you then try to refine it and adjust it to be closer to what you really want, you'll run into all kinds of problems. 

Instead, start with getting clear on the detailed requirements for your app: have a discussion with the AI about it. Start with your description of what you want, ask it what's missing, what's not clear, what would it suggest improving. Have it ask you questions. Keep iterating on the requirements description until you  get something very clear and detailed. 

THEN ask the AI to build the app, and iterate from there.",comment,7일 전,3400,147949,504000,7일 전,2025-11-26,바이브 코딩,0.43609235

People get amazed that such a tiny prompt can generate something that actually runs.
To me, that’s not really the surprising part. When you give an AI almost no requirements, it just fills in the gaps however it wants — and honestly that’s the easy mode.
What’s actually hard is getting it to build EXACTLY what you intended, with well-defined, detailed requirements.
But the truth is, most of the time we can’t think through every little detail upfront. And if we keep adding or correcting things along the way, the app usually turns into a BIG messy pile of code that only works if you get lucky.
So I’ve been doing something kind of counterintuitive: even when I’m not totally sure what I want, I just let the AI build its own version first.
Then, by looking at what it came up with, I suddenly realize — ohh, THAT’s what I actually meant. After that, I just toss all that code out and write a much cleaner plan for the real thing.
This used to be unrealistic because rewriting everything was too expensive. But now that code is basically FREE, starting over doesn’t hurt at all.",comment,7일 전,3400,147949,504000,5일 전,2025-11-26,바이브 코딩,0.43609235

My suggesstion:
Actual result is not necessary. If test case is failed you will be changing the status of it. Once bug fixed, u will retest the test case and change the status to pass.
Test case name is missing in this.
Test description - by the name we can understand that it should be descriptive. So elobrate the test case description.",comment,8년 전,29000,2220926,166000,5년 전(수정됨),2025-11-26,Testcase Management System,0.53205997

I've been experimenting with a wide range of art styles and blends of art styles using my own storm photography and compositions as a foundation, and this tool has given me the ability to create scenes I used to only dream about. I don't have any other social media, and I'll upload what I've been doing in the months ahead, but I really wish I could show you Google devs what you've allowed me to do right now. Can't thank you enough. Feel like a kid again when I got my first Nintendo and a universe of imagination opened up. Haven't had this spark in years. Can't wait to see where this tech goes...

One issue that needs to be corrected is where the AI mixes up different characters’ lines in scenes that have multiple characters. The AI is unable to tell the characters apart, so sometimes it will have one character say the lines of the other character, and vice versa. I’d like to be able to work with ‘Image to Video’, have the ability to clearly point out to the AI which character is which to avoid mixups, specify a unique voice for each of my consistent characters, and have that character’s voice stay the same in every generation, instead of changing every time. Additionally, there is an issue where characters sometimes don’t say their full lines, and the video gets cut short without the character saying all of their lines. This really needs to be fixed, because we don’t want to end up with wasted videos.",comment,6개월 전,17000,1409576,13600000,5개월 전,2025-11-26,AI Human-in-the-loop,0.5012304

I'm not criticizing the technology itself, which is an impressive achievement (kudos to the team!), but rather the monetization model, which seems a bit excessive in its current form.

A system based on 100 generations would be fine if the success rate was around 90%. But when you’re dealing with only 30–40% of usable outputs, that’s a lot of money burned with little to show for it. And that’s not even considering the learning curve that naturally comes with a brand-new tool, or the lack of official technical documentation from Google to help creators get started efficiently.

It feels a bit harsh, especially at this price point. I sincerely hope Google will adjust its pricing model or provide better support and transparency moving forward.

I am a subscriber of the Ultra plan and would like to report a recurring issue. I have noticed that more than 70% of the videos generated are coming with problems, which significantly impacts the overall experience.

I believe there should be a mechanism to validate whether the output aligns with the original prompt. If the generated video fails to meet at least 70% of the requested content, the corresponding credit should not be deducted.

Furthermore, I recently used the option to include audio in a video, but the result was delivered without any sound. In such cases, I believe it would be fair to automatically refund the credits used.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to a resolution so that I may continue using the service with confidence and satisfaction.",comment,6개월 전,17000,1409576,13600000,5개월 전,2025-11-26,AI Human-in-the-loop,0.5012304

Meaning this is new software that no matter what, to get anything done as you see here, you must learn how to produce anything that can be used for professional services (which professional is the only way you could justify paying $150 clams a month), and there's no 30 trial after buying. It's a great leap forward, but it ain't ever what you see in the ad. It took me all night and into the morning to produce one clip I could use. It wasn't what I wanted exactly, but it is a very nice 8-second clip.

AI가 연 '바이브 코딩'과 로우코드/노코드 부상, 진짜 개발자는 없어지나?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPVTY0M4hE&pp=ygUaQUkg7YWM7Iqk7Yq4IOy9lOuTnCDsnpHshLE%3D,Uploader(Desc),"인공지능 코딩 보조 기술인 '바이브 코딩'과 로우코드/노코드 도구의 부상으로 소프트웨어 개발 방식이 근본적으로 변화하고 있습니다. 테슬라와 OpenAI에서 활동한 안드레이 카파시가 제시한 바이브 코딩은 AI에게 자연어로 지시하여 프로그램을 만드는 새로운 코딩 방식입니다. 이는 GPT-4, LLaMA 같은 초거대 언어 모델이 방대한 데이터로 학습되어 가능해졌습니다. 대표적인 AI 코딩 도구인 Cursor AI나 GitHub Copilot은 코드 생성 및 수정, 버그 해결 보조 등을 통해 개발 생산성을 크게 높이고 있습니다. AI가 코딩 작업 속도를 평균 55%까지 빠르게 하지만, 개발자는 AI가 생성한 코드를 검토하고 통합하는 데 더 많은 시간을 할애하기도 합니다. 한편, 로우코드/노코드 플랫폼은 적은 코드 또는 코드 작성 없이도 애플리케이션 제작을 가능하게 하여 개발의 민주화를 목표로 합니다. 이는 개발 인력 부족과 소프트웨어 수요 증가 문제를 해결하고, 현업과 개발자 간 소통을 원활하게 하는 대안으로 주목받고 있습니다. 가트너에 따르면 글로벌 로우코드/노코드 시장은 고속 성장 중이며, Microsoft Power Platform과 같은 플랫폼은 이미 수천만 명의 사용자를 확보했습니다. 흥미롭게도 로우코드 툴의 주요 사용자는 오히려 전문 개발자들이며, 비개발자의 활용도 AI 통합으로 점차 쉬워지고 있습니다. 이러한 변화는 개발자의 역할을 단순 코딩에서 벗어나 설계, 관리, AI와의 협업 중심으로 변화시킬 것입니다. 개발자는 AI의 산출물을 검토하고 조정하는 디렉터나 품질관리자 역할을 수행하며, 기본기 강화와 함께 인간 고유의 문제 해결 및 설계 역량이 더욱 중요해집니다. 결국 AI 코딩 보조와 로우코드/노코드 도구를 능동적으로 받아들이고 자신의 역량을 재정비하는 개발자가 이 변화의 시대에 가치 있는 인재로 남을 것입니다.

개발자는 디버깅이 숙명이라는 말 처럼 수정작업이 익숙해서 괜찮지만, 비개발직들은 이걸 해결하기 위해선 플랜을 완벽하게 짜야합니다.
여기 영상에서는 단순한 기본 모델을 단순 프롬프트로 제작하고 그위에 기능을 추가하는 수순이라 단순하게 제작이 되었는데
기능이 복잡하고 완벽도가 높은 서비스일수록 플랜도 완벽해야합니다.
해서, 비개발군이 바이브코딩을 효과적으로 하려면, 일단 ai 에게 계획서를 치밀하게 만들도록 시키고,
그것을 본인이 직접 검토후에 프로토 타입을 만들어보고 플랜을 수정해 나가야 합니다.
마음에 드는 수준의 프로토 타입이 나오면 그때 그 계획서를 들고 제작해달라고 하면 손댈부분이 많이 없습니다.
실제로 바이브코딩을 하시는 개발자 동기들 보면 일단 플랜을 세밀하게 제작시키고 그것에 맞춰 개발을 시킵니다.
개발자가 아니더라도 플랜부터 시키는게 어려운건 아니니 위 방법을 추천드립니다.
플랜만 잘 짜여있으면 만들어진 서비스를 고치는거보다 플랜 수정해서 다시 만들게 시키는게 효과적일때도 있습니다.",comment,5개월 전,2100,70057,685000,3개월 전,2025-11-26,AI 테스트 코드 작성,0.6439814

Like yourself I see ChatGPT as a way to get up and going fast with test automation code.  
A lazy developer might copy/paste code from ChatGPT output but that output is not perfect. 
This enforces the need for test automation, not the other way around.

Further, ChatGPT can write unit tests but I do not think it can write integration or system test automation; hence, there is still a real need for people to fulfill that role.",comment,2년 전,569,60949,110000,2년 전,2025-11-26,AI 테스트 코드 작성,0.5484897

여러분, 구글이 미친 게 틀림없습니다. 그동안 월 20달러씩 내고 쓰던 '커서(Cursor)'나 '클로드' 구독을 고민하게 만드는, 구글의 야심작 '안티그래비티(Antigravity)'가 출시되었습니다.

가장 충격적인 건 '가격'과 '성능'입니다. 현재 안티그래비티는 모든 플랜이 무료이며, 심지어 구글의 최신 모델인 제미나이 3 프로(Gemini 3 Pro)까지 무제한으로 사용할 수 있습니다.

기존에는 리눅스 설치 등 복잡한 과정이 필요했던 에이전트 코딩을 윈도우에서도 클릭 몇 번으로 설치할 수 있고 , AI 에이전트가 인터넷 검색부터 코드 작성, 브라우저 테스트까지 '알아서' 수행합니다.

오늘 영상에서는 안티그래비티의 설치부터, 제미나이 3 프로를 활용해 랜딩 페이지를 순식간에 리디자인하는 '바이브 코딩' 실전까지 모두 담았습니다. 유료화되기 전에 지금 바로 경험해보세요!

[영상 핵심 요약]
🚀 Gemini 3 Pro 무제한: 월 결제 없이 최고 성능 AI 모델 사용
💸 Cursor 대체 가능?: 설치부터 사용법까지 완벽 가이드
🤖 자율주행 에이전트: 코드 작성부터 웹사이트 테스트까지 자동화
🎨 바이브 코딩: 디자인 몰라도 말로 다 되는 웹사이트 제작

📌 이번 영상 소개

이번 영상은 커서를 활용해서 테스트 코드를 자동화 하는 방법을 말씀 드립니다.
테스트 코드를 작성하면 AI 주도 개발의 단점인 버그 발생이나 코드 안정성 문제를 굉장히 많이 개선할 수 있습니다. 

영상 길이가 길어서 타임라인 추가했습니다. 
필요하신 분들은 타임라인 참고해주세요 :)

Build these simple beginner Python projects to practice your Python skills and bolster your portfolio.

Python is one of the most powerful programming languages out there due to its versatility and the prevalence of libraries to achieve all sorts of interesting things.

These are some examples of Python scripting projects you can do as a beginner very easily to see the power of the Python programming language and learn to code in the process.

I also teach the basics of zsh shell scripting to make running these programs from your terminal window even easier.

Or a lady which hammered her keyboard right beside the microphone. How should someone proper learn from that content?
 
 Okay the CTRL Key seems to be right beside your mic right? Each time to copy or paste something it‘s clear you pressed a key very loud.
 
 what happened? You sound so much quieter
 
 But if i turn it up it‘s okay. Anyway it‘s a way better video than the other ones i watched before!
 
 i love that someone really specifies all the tags you find in that chaos of a modern website, very well explained

If you have an ESP microcontroller in your home, don't miss this video!

In the next few minutes we will build a home automation unit with AI, we will not write any code at all, we will not even use a keyboard!

Our unit will be able to control two bulbs and RGB strip, online and offline using our smartphone, we will be able to control them with RF remote controllers, and of course the regular wall switches.

Our devices will work with ALEXA echo devices, also with Google home.

We will be able to set timers and schedules, receive notifications, and control the devices with our voice.

We will add a digital sensor, and a DHT to measure temperature and humidity, and link them with our devices to create an automation.

All the software will be handled by CADIO platform, we just need to install CADIO firmware on the ESP, and tell CADIO some information about our unit, and boom, job done!

CADIO app is available on google play store for android devices, and apple app store for IOS, we will download CADIO app, and create an account by entering our email address and choosing a password and enter it twice, now we have a CADIO account, we can now configure and link our units to it.

To install CADIO firmware on ESP8266, we need to download the latest CADIO firmware, and the ESP flash download tool, all these files can be downloaded from CADIO downloads center.

Now we open the ESP flash download tool and select ESP8266, then select the firmware file and set the address to 0x0, set the flash mode to DIO and the speed to 40MHz, then select the port, and click erase to clear the ESP flash from any stored data.

After erasing the flash we click start to download the firmware on the Esp.

and when downloading is done, we reset the ESP, and after seconds.. CADIO firmware will be installed and the ESP will be ready for receiving the info file.

we can build units with any architecture we want, in this unit I have connected 2 relays to GPIO4 and 5, 2 switches to GPIO12 and 14, addressable RGB to GPIO15, DHT to GPIO10, and a digital sensor to GPIO3, I'm using an IR sensor, I have connected also RF receiver module to GPIO13.

After CADIO firmware is installed on the ESP, the ESP will create a WIFI network for receiving the info file and configuration.

We open the CADIO app and go to the configuration section, and connect the phone to the ESP WIFI network, in seconds, the connection will establish and the info file page will appear.

The Info file page will create the info file based on our preferences, and all codes will be internally created with the power of AI.

now I will tell CADIO about my unit, for example, my relays module is active-low, so I will set relays mode to active-low, my unit has a 433 Megahertz RF receiver, so I will activate the 433 Megahertz and select the GPIO.

In the devices table, I will add my devices and select their GPIOs, 2 on off devices, RGB, DHT, and a sensor, and simply select their GPIOs.

then I will send the info file to the ESP.

Now the configuration page appears, all we need to do is enter our home router WIFI network details, so our unit can connect to the internet.

After saving the configuration, the unit will start scanning networks, and connecting to our home network, and connect to the internet, and appear in the application interface.

and now our unit is ready!

Back in early 2000's we controlled all ETL and real-time loads with Unix or DOS or SQL scripts that provided return codes for success/failure which triggered alert emails, and we had KPI's for Data quality, backing-out jobs for failed loads, and many other control systems. It just seems there are more 'out-of-the-box' software to handle these now as opposed to custom-built solutions.

Elon Musk ruined the API part, you can use some other APIs

Here's one of the subscriber built the same project using other APIs - https://chenmeiqiao.notion.site/How-I-Reach-Out-to-YouTubers-I-Like-As-A-Data-Engineer-c37bdddefde54c3789229ffa5a789432

or you can use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it


FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - 

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access

The amount of value you bring to the viewer in just 12 minutes is just incredible! Like you were saying ""the hassle of managing pipelines in python scripts"", I made a data project a while back, and I really can understand what you mean. I heard that Airflow makes everything easier, but I kept deferring Airflow learning, partly because ""maybe this is good for large data pipelines, but my one consists of just a few small tasks,"" and also because most YouTube videos of Airflow out there was a couple of hours long. And that's great if you are already committed to learn Airflow, but I was really looking for a video like yours - something that will give me a practical demo of how Airflow actually works, but it will be around 10-15 minutes. And this video was just perfect. Once again, thanks a whole lot! I'll definitely be integrating Airflow into my project now!

Who am I? 🙋🏻‍♂️
I'm Jay, I love making videos about travel, self-help and tech. I currently work in New York City as a data engineer, but I grew up in Malaysia and lived in the UK when I was 19. Back then, I had no idea what life was about, moving to so many places, navigating career in Tech. Today, I've learned a lot and wanna share my perspective through filmmaking.

I'd be happy to see you doing more ELT pipelines and focus on your thought's process ( I can watch longer format 1-2 hours) -  why you do things in that way, why is it important and whatnot; and you can throw some explainers to anything else you do and the reason behind it. I think senior DE and others with experience do things bit automatically and it takes time for the newbies to pick up on those skills. So, your thought process for doing things instead of just doing the things is priceless for anyone watching, including me.

What Is DBT and Why Is It So Popular -  Intro To Data Infrastructure Part 3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FZZivIfJVo&pp=ygUdREJUIOuNsOydtO2EsCDtjIzsnbTtlITrnbzsnbg%3D,Uploader(Desc),"dbt란 무엇일까요?

Fishtown Analytics(현 dbt Labs)에서 개발한 데이터 빌드 도구 또는 dbt는 데이터 분석가, 데이터 엔지니어, 분석 엔지니어가 추출-로드-변환 파이프라인에서 ""변환"" 단계를 실행할 수 있도록 지원합니다.

SQL로 변환을 작성하고 회사 데이터베이스에 대해 실행하면 됩니다.

""분석 엔지니어링 도구""라고도 불리는 dbt는 오픈 소스이며 많은 기업의 최신 데이터 스택에 필수적인 요소로 자리 잡았습니다. 또한 dbt를 중심으로 탄탄한 지원 커뮤니티가 형성되어 있습니다.

Snowflake, Databricks 또는 Bigquery와 같은 다른 데이터 플랫폼에 로드할 도구를 찾고 계신가요? Estuary를 사용해 보세요. 저는 Estuary와 파트너십을 맺기 전에 여러 고객에게 Estuary를 사용했는데, Estuary 덕분에 전체 프로세스가 훨씬 수월해졌습니다.

Back in early 2000's we controlled all ETL and real-time loads with Unix or DOS or SQL scripts that provided return codes for success/failure which triggered alert emails, and we had KPI's for Data quality, backing-out jobs for failed loads, and many other control systems. It just seems there are more 'out-of-the-box' software to handle these now as opposed to custom-built solutions.

Elon Musk ruined the API part, you can use some other APIs

Here's one of the subscriber built the same project using other APIs - https://chenmeiqiao.notion.site/How-I-Reach-Out-to-YouTubers-I-Like-As-A-Data-Engineer-c37bdddefde54c3789229ffa5a789432

or you can use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it


FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - 

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access

The amount of value you bring to the viewer in just 12 minutes is just incredible! Like you were saying ""the hassle of managing pipelines in python scripts"", I made a data project a while back, and I really can understand what you mean. I heard that Airflow makes everything easier, but I kept deferring Airflow learning, partly because ""maybe this is good for large data pipelines, but my one consists of just a few small tasks,"" and also because most YouTube videos of Airflow out there was a couple of hours long. And that's great if you are already committed to learn Airflow, but I was really looking for a video like yours - something that will give me a practical demo of how Airflow actually works, but it will be around 10-15 minutes. And this video was just perfect. Once again, thanks a whole lot! I'll definitely be integrating Airflow into my project now!

Who am I? 🙋🏻‍♂️
I'm Jay, I love making videos about travel, self-help and tech. I currently work in New York City as a data engineer, but I grew up in Malaysia and lived in the UK when I was 19. Back then, I had no idea what life was about, moving to so many places, navigating career in Tech. Today, I've learned a lot and wanna share my perspective through filmmaking.

I'd be happy to see you doing more ELT pipelines and focus on your thought's process ( I can watch longer format 1-2 hours) -  why you do things in that way, why is it important and whatnot; and you can throw some explainers to anything else you do and the reason behind it. I think senior DE and others with experience do things bit automatically and it takes time for the newbies to pick up on those skills. So, your thought process for doing things instead of just doing the things is priceless for anyone watching, including me.
